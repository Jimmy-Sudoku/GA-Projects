0,depression,"drunk, confused, and depressed?","I dunno, I'm posting here cuz I think I'm having an episode but it's hard to tell through all the booze. Im so touch starved and lonely in the presence of loving people that I just don't know what to feel anymore. I have moments where the fog clears and I realize how truly depressed I really am, but it's like I'm pretending so well I fool myself sometimes. Sometimes I feel fine and normal, and other times, like rn, I feel like I'm a hopeless messa nd it's only a matter of time.before I'm dead. I dunno... Anyone wanna talk? I dunno lmfao I just don't even know what I'm doing anymore.."
1,depression,Question,You ever feel like something is wrong with you everyday no matter what it is? Its like you can never catch a break
2,depression,Cant get homework done,I have multiple chemistry packets due tonight for a test grade. I‚Äôve completed them all already but I don‚Äôt have the motivation to submit them. My teacher wants us to submit them online and scan/take a picture of each document. Im so tired i can‚Äôt even do something as simple as scanning a document. I wish I was dead already.  As a result i‚Äôm turning them in late. I‚Äôm so pathetic compared to the rest of my peers who consistently get their work done.
3,depression,I think I would be happier if my family forgot about me,"I would be free of this situation i‚Äôm in, I would be free of manipulation and control, I would be free of weird burden 

fuck. sometimes i feel like shit and i just gotta keep going and i hate it and i hate when i feel so angry and uneasy and sad at the same time

Whenever i feel good i gotta fall so hard and i want to get better but i‚Äôm prolly neurotic or some shit lol but i don‚Äôt even trust myself enough to validate how i feel

even venting doesn‚Äôt feel good"

6,depression,Sleeping too much. Advice?,"Background: Been diagnosed with depression, anxiety disorder and OCD. Been on Citalopram 20mg for the past 2 years. That helps with the anxiety and OCD a lot, but it makes me sleepy.

For the past year or so i've been occasionally suffering with Hypersomnia = sleeping too much. This fall it has caused me a lot of problems. For example, i can sleep for 14 hours, then be awake for 5 hours until i feel super tired again. I go for ""a nap"" and sleep another 10-14 hours. And then i'm just stuck in this cycle for weeks. I feel fatigued all the time, like i can't even sit on my computer without getting tired.

I've been prescribed Bupropion in the past. It helped for one week, then the stimulating effect weaned off and all that was left was my brain going too fast and then i couldn't fall asleep at all. It made me feel psychotic at night.

Has anyone had a similar experience and how did you come over it? I don't want to sleep my life away..."
7,depression,What happens if you tell your psych about ‚Äúsuicidal‚Äù feelings?,"If I tell my psychiatrist at my next appointment that I‚Äôve had suicidal feelings (not with an active plan, but not wanting to be alive) in the past few weeks but not right in that moment what will he do?"
8,depression,"I Want Things to Change, I want to change","It‚Äôs been rough and it‚Äôs still hard. I grew up in a cult and lost my whole world of people and everything and am now 17 and missed out on my entire childhood. I‚Äôll never get to know what it‚Äôs like to be a teen. I‚Äôve tried so damn hard to get friends, take every opportunity but I still feel so depressed. I‚Äôve made some connections this semester (doing a college program offered by my state) and have done a couple more things with people but still don‚Äôt have that community, those friends that you don‚Äôt worry about if they like you or not, the ones who you know value you as much as you do to you. My whole childhood I was did all the work in my friendships and right now in my life I still feel like I give people more then what I receive generally and that‚Äôs hard. I want to be appreciated and loved, I want my group of friends who I go to watch movies with. I‚Äôm an outsider who knows some people but I don‚Äôt have that connection. Doesn‚Äôt help that there was this guy that I liked (and still do) who I thought liked me back but turns out he‚Äôs asexual. Also worries me cause he used to take more initiative with me but now never checks in on me or asks to hang out. Worst part is I can‚Äôt get over him and feel like I‚Äôll never get an opportunity like this again or at least be a teenager like this. I‚Äôm just really depressed and do have mental health issues but just feeling very crummy about this tonight. Yes I‚Äôm gay fuck off. I feel so sentimental, it feels like a dream reality and I don‚Äôt know I am so nostalgic and feel out of this world. Please universe help me. I didn‚Äôt get a childhood and now I‚Äôm gonna be forced to be an adult which sounds so awful."
9,depression,life is kinda mid,"Idk how to describe how I'm feeling, it's like a mix of loneliness and sadness. Idk what to do with myself"
10,depression,Life just doesn‚Äôt have that spark anymore,"I‚Äôve been depressed for years, with the depression varying greatly depending on the era. I‚Äôve also been looking back at 2020 and how much has happened in that year globally. How many memes, how much destruction, how much international attention certain things received, etc. At this moment right now, it feels like nothing big is happening, and hasn‚Äôt happened for like 9 months. My personal life hasn‚Äôt seen much surprise and ambition either, and it‚Äôs been like that for months. Life all around just feels stale. Like I‚Äôm still alive for no real reason. Like the show is over. I just can‚Äôt take it anymore. 

I guess my point is I want big things to happen again. Whether internationally or personally."
11,depression,I hate I feel so damn broken,I hate I can‚Äôt connect with anyone and tbh don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm writing this I‚Äôm lost üòû why can‚Äôt I ever be good enough for someone just once fuck bs ..
12,depression,The winds that blow South,"I have been for over an year, all I see is dreary and lack of affable opportunities. I am not a native, I am a migrant here from North. I eat, sleep and get through the day. Sometimes I play a part, sometimes I play many. I am no longer able to recognise the man I come across in the mirror, sometimes I am myself, and those times I struggle socially.

They ask me nothing, I am always all ears. I never speak. When I do I'm so apparent. But that apparentness is apparentless, they never acknowledge me or my feelings adequately.

I have lost the ability to form meaningful relationships with women. I have lost my ability to form a romantic relationship. My past truama still haunts me. I am 21 and lost. Maybe I'll get out and be better, maybe it's not that bad. But each day I'm struggling to get out of my bed.

My dreams are better than my real life. And they wonder why I don't wake up on time. Going to uni is such a drag, the burden that weighs on me crushes my windpipe, I sometimes hope it really would. I can not be here any longer."
13,depression,You lose interest in things that you enjoyed is a symptom. What if I never enjoyed anything or intrigued me?,What it would make me? I loved to stay inside my head and live in my own world

15,depression,Wanting to kill myself,Hey y‚Äôall just wanted to share. It feels I‚Äôve had nothing but bad things happen to me lately and everything seems so pointless. I just want to get away from it all and not have to deal with it. I feel so lonely and scared and idk what to do about it
16,depression,Why even bother‚Ä¶,"We are a miracle from the universe aren‚Äôt we? The odds of life existing in this caos leading entropy we know as existence are nearly 0, and here we are. Would you call it luck? Fuck man I rather not, destiny? Fuck no. Determinism, probably‚Ä¶ at the end of the day we will all be gone sooner or later. I‚Äôd like it sooner"
17,depression,I don‚Äôt understand how people care about life,"I don‚Äôt understand how people find the motivation to care about life. I‚Äôm 25 and I‚Äôve been sitting on my ass for 4 years avoiding working. I have no energy to do anything unless it‚Äôs a spur of the moment thing that involves 98% fun and less than 2% work (like watching YouTube, playing video games, watching tv). In the past year I have quit 6 jobs after being there for less than a week. I have never kept a job for longer than a week other than Doordash, which I‚Äôm able to continue doing because I can set my own schedule. I‚Äôll go a week or two without dashing at all, and then dash for a couple days nonstop when I need money. I say I want a relationship but I never put in any work to have one. I have ZERO social life, I haven‚Äôt been to a social event in 3-4 years, and even then if I went to one I‚Äôd leave after 5 minutes because the social situation made me uncomfortable. I get nervous and sweaty just from going to a restaurant or store. And the worst part is I don‚Äôt WANT to get better. I don‚Äôt want to work. I don‚Äôt want to socialize. I just want a girlfriend, money, to be able to live how I want..basically I want the end result without putting in the work and I have no clue how to change that. It‚Äôs so deeply in me to not want to work, I feel it with every fiber of my being. When I tell this to my family they just don‚Äôt understand. I lie to my family and say I have a job just so that they‚Äôll continue helping me pay for things I need and so that they want constantly pester me about needing to get a life. I understand people who commit crimes and hurt people more than I understand people who work and socialize and try in life."
18,depression,I don‚Äôt see a future,The title says it all. I don‚Äôt see myself being alive ten years from now. It‚Äôs not due to suicidal reasons but rather just overthinking. I don‚Äôt see myself being successful or marrying or being alive in general. It‚Äôs so weird. I hate it and I always think about it. I feel like i‚Äôm gonna die somehow in a non natural way. I‚Äôm scheduling an appointment soon to get my blood checked because two years back stuff were unusual and I have a chance of getting lupus. I just hope I get to live a long healthy religious life. I hate being sad.
19,depression,Do You Think I am a Terrible Person For Wanting to Leave My Parents?,[removed]
20,depression,Art and limbo,"I'm out of options. I've reached what feels like a guarantee that nothing will change for the better from here on out.

Imagine this. If you went to a therapist, because you're suicidal, because say you lost your arms and can't use them, what will they do? They'll try working you around it. Getting you to just live with it, to cope with it. They can't make your arms come back.

It's a drastic comparison, but it still works. You can picture this with my art pains.

About two and a half years now, this same thing has haunted me. And as much as I love talking about it, I'll admit it for once that this is merely the straw that broke the camel's back. I already tried shooting myself in 2016. And I failed.

It's the single biggest regret of my entire life. I could've been nonexistent by now. I wouldn't have had to experience an ounce of the envy. I wouldn't have had to find a version of myself who didn't fail in every aspect. I wouldn't have had to witness my ideas and desires already executed and perfected. I wouldn't have had to end up slamming my head into walls out of the frustration, the anguish, and the emptiness it all brought onto me from then on.

I have no passion, and I can't force it either. So I can't enjoy the process. So I won't just do it, and I won't go anywhere.

It's like the universe is looking me dead in the eyes, and asking. ""Why haven't you necked yourself yet?""

Because I'm scared. It's because I'm scared. No amount of being pissed off and resentful of the universe for existing will make me feel even slightly comfortable or entitled to something that isn't just more bullshit waiting patiently on the other side.

Even if I somehow pushed through this passion barrier of mine, it'd be years of work before any of it looked tolerable. My ideas can't even be considered my own anymore. And awful free-time lacking adult life is kicking in, in a world that already provoked a suicide attempt out of me before any of this art crap, way back when I was just 14.

I'll say it yet again. Everything I should've been is already out there. And I'm not exactly puncturing a hole in the art spectrum with my death, or just lack of contribution.

I'll never write anything worth reading. I'll never compose anything worth listening. I'll never draw anything worth witnessing. I'll never do anything worth acknowledging.

And sure, not if I'm dead. And if I'm gonna die anyways, why not try? So I tried.

I tried once, it felt awful. Soul-draining, tiring. I ended up going nowhere, and haven't touched drawing for 8 months now.

Then I tried again, something else. Doesn't work, my circumstances forbid it. Probably wouldn't have gone anywhere anyways.

And then I tried again, something else.

""dime-a-dozen""

""boring""

And I couldn't agree more. That's just what happens when I try to do anything. Not like it would've gone anywhere in the end, it depended on me being capable of art, but I'm just a complete failure.

Everything sucks. I hate it all. Nothing interests me anymore.

My only dreams are perpetual infeasibilities.

The days of having free time and getting enough sleep to make waking up worth it are long gone.

I wish my dad loved my mom.

I don't want to die. I don't want to do anything anymore.

I just wish I never existed."
21,depression,How to university/college with shite mental health?,"Basically i have no energy to do anything but sleep. I literally spent the entire weekend sleeping. IM 10 weeks behind on content and have 3 finals coming up in 30 days yet i cant bring myself to study at all. I procrastinate every single thing. It was 50 days 3 weeks ago but in the blink of an eye i wasted 3 weeks just like that. My gpa is already shit and this is my last chance to improve it. I also need to learn coding in 3 weeks and code a simple game.

Im so lost. i skip lessons and dont go to campus. I got no friends or money. Sleeping helps me escape for a brief period of time. I have a report that is due in about 40 hours that i had 3 weeks to work on but i havent started jackshit. Seeing people on campus being happy and enjoying the ebst times of their lives gives me so much anxiety and that is why i stopped going to campuis. I thought this year 2 would be different but im repeating what i did in year 1 again and again. I hate my major and cannot change it. my brain just feels like it is in a permanent brain rot. 

Please what do i do."
22,depression,My own mother,My own fucking mother makes me want to kill myself at times. She lies and does me so fucking wrong. I‚Äôve made mistakes in life but why does she have to keep bringing it up. Why can‚Äôt I ever just be good enough. She has messed me up so bad I can‚Äôt even find a job and I‚Äôm 26 living at home. I‚Äôve had to grow up bullied and treated wrong by everyone. People who we‚Äôre supposed to be friends stole from me. I went all through school wanting friends and to just be happy. In college I just kept getting bullied and then having to go home to more abuse. Even my professors treated me bad. I don‚Äôt feel like I have a purpose in life. Everything I ever do fails. I try my hardest every fucking day just to fail. It‚Äôs so bad I play games and make goals in the game to try to feel like I‚Äôm good at something just to never reach the goals I set. I just want to feel like I‚Äôm meant for something.

29,depression,Scared to be completely alone,"I‚Äôve been living and working in another country for the past 13 years. Im 38 years to be soon, and newly single, just out of a toxic relationship. I only have my mother, who‚Äôs always been a single mother. No siblings, no new partner, no kids. Im scared to hell of being completely alone when my mother goes. I feel so depressed, no energy, no ambition, feels like there‚Äôs no future. I wonder what it‚Äôs like to stay home without a job until all of my savings are gone, and then end my life after I become completely alone"
30,depression,My friend needs help and idk what to do,"Hi guys. Here is some background. Me and my floor mate are first years in college. We are both engineering majors but different majors but tons of overlap so we have similar classes. Also, we are both bs/ms students. What does this mean? We are already committed to grad school and we need to maintain a 3.4 (all As and A-s for the most part). We are supposed to finish what takes most people 12 semesters in 7 plus an internship or two. Also we r both ahead of plan as we r in 2nd year classes some and next semester all 2nd year classes. 

Now I got lucky this semester. I got the best proffessors and classes. My floor mate on the other hand got one of the hardest math professors ever. And he‚Äôs a smart guy. He got an 83 on the recent test when the class average was a 63. This shows u how hard this professor is. But it‚Äôs not only this class. He has another like it. Anyway, he isn‚Äôt keeping up that 3.4 for now but I think he can get it eventually. Regardless, it‚Äôs rocking him hard. No matter how much work he puts in, he just keeps getting beat down. We only chose this college because of this program so now it‚Äôs seeming like a distant dream. 

Today I found out that he is being put on anti depression medication but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to fix anything. He told me a lot that no one else knows and I don‚Äôt want to tell them because then I won‚Äôt know if something more serious happens cause he might not trust me. I fear for him and I don‚Äôt know what to do"
31,depression,how do people live,"I hate my flat. I look for work, but pay is so low that the best i could hope for is to work to 70 to buy a shithole comparable to the shithole i currently rent from a shit tier hoa. Ohhh but you have to start somewhere - except my cv isnt blank, i had shit tier jobs when i was younger. Ohhh why dont you go back to studying - except i have qualifications that are apparently worthless and any further study stops my benefit unless i want to commit to 8 years of study to get an undergrad that'll start me off on a shit wage anyway and still be trapped in the same dilema. Life just doesnt seem worth living. The monotony is and idea of being trapped in this flat until i die just makes me want to die faster. It's a situation that just feels impossible to escape. If it wasnt for my cat i wouldnt get out of bed, most likely wouldnt still be here, but im considering giving her up, can barely scrape the motivation to look after myself"
32,depression,Does therapy help,Just wondering if therapy even does anything been on antidepressants for around a year now even had my dose made higher three times but they still don‚Äôt work I just want a way to feel something again
33,depression,How do I stop the cycle?,I have been super depressed for about 4 years and only mildly depressed before that. But the decisions I make I can see why I am depressed. I can‚Äôt tell if I make myself depressed or I make bad decisions because I am depressed. Where do you get the willpower from to change after its been so long and your life is so bad that even the smallest things seem so big to change? I can‚Äôt get out of the cycle.
34,depression,Confused and lost,"Is it just me or does anyone else feel more and more restless everyday, waiting for something to happen, but you don‚Äôt even know what that something is. And as days go by, you become more and more disillusioned and lost and you don‚Äôt even know what you‚Äôre doing anymore or why you‚Äôre doing anything at all. And all this just makes you so exhausted that you wonder what even is the point of anything and you just have energy left to go on."
35,depression,I'm giving up. last therapy appointment today,"Its 330 am. Its been 2 years of ""therapy"". 3 years of not working. I do nothing. I am nothing. But a burden. Its not a idea. Its a fact. I can't make myself change. I dont even want to. I just want it to stop. Idk why im posting this. Its getting to the point where I'm just either numb or angry. Very angry. I'm done."

37,depression,Exhaustion,"I‚Äôve never been happy my entire life. I had a horrible childhood with abusive parents to the point that I can‚Äôt function. I hear a loud noise and I lock up for a bit because I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs my dad ready to hit me again, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave my house and socialize so I have no social skills to go out and make friends. My only relationship after 21 years of living turned out horrible and scarred me multiple ways

I finally found someone who I truly cared for, loved deeply beyond belief and would do anything for, literally everything I‚Äôve ever wanted out of someone in a relationship, but of course they are on the other side of the world. Like how cruel is that. It‚Äôs like I finally get handed a bone in life, but it‚Äôs got all of these different catches for me to actually earn that bone (even though my entire life up to this point might as well have been the catches to earn the bone). Then when I finally decide to make the most of the situation and rise to the challenge, that bone is taken away.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I don‚Äôt find enjoyment in anything anymore, I have no drive to do anything better with myself, I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I did everything I could to make her as happy as I could and it wasn‚Äôt enough. I just never feel I‚Äôm enough and life keeps proving that feeling correct

I don‚Äôt even have the energy to finish this post. I just want to be ignored by everyone, I want to rot away and do nothing with my life. 

I don‚Äôt even know what I want from making this post. Maybe I just want someone to hear my problems and pretend they care, maybe I just want to vent my problems to the wind and then forget about them like I‚Äôve always done, maybe I want someone to reach out. I don‚Äôt even know. I guess maybe some guidance on what to do with myself would be nice"
38,depression,I CARE!,"I will read your post and try my best to respond because I care about you, anyone who‚Äôs dealing with sadness, anxiousness, loneliness, depression, etc. I care!! You don‚Äôt have to go through it alone! If I could/can help and and save someone, I freaking will!"
39,depression,I think I might explode.,"Hey. I have controlling parents, I cut off a really close toxic friend a month ago (he has depression, anxiety and ADHD) and this is the longest I have spent not talking to him, my boyfriend doesn't have time for me, I lost my position in my college society because I failed to come to the interview, my friends are in different states, I have harm OCD and basically I feel lonely. I am not lonely mind it...but I feel lonely.

Sometimes I think....if I off myself...that'd be the most peaceful I'd feel in a long time...I cannot believe I am saying this; I swear if you saw me at my prime I was so happy, joyous, laughing girl. I made everyone's day. People called me because they knew talking to me would make them happy. I have some really genuine friends....and my boyfriend loves me. My parents do too...but I just wanna rest man. I felt so happy looking through some tombstones epitaphs. Somehow.

I feel drained now. I don't really have much expectations from anyone. I have been let down too much. Fuck I have let myself down too. 

I talk politely. I have never raised my voice on anyone. I dont have angry outbursts. I dont even remember the last time I felt angry. I find no will. I am surrounded by people who love me. They really do. And would be broken if I leave. But....

I think I have lit the match. I will soon burn the bridge. Not anytime soon but I know I would go down with it.

Things will get better tomorrow, I will laugh and go on a double date with my boyfriend, meet my friends, go to college, study literature...do the things I love but now it has become lifeless. I don't...feel it.

Sorry if this seems like a damsel in distress lmao. Just letting out stuff buried in me."

42,depression,Wondering if I‚Äôm getting depression?,"I‚Äôm 21F in college. Found out I was pregnant and got left by him after. I loved him too.

 I‚Äôm trying to be logical about everything: that we wouldn‚Äôt have ever worked, that it was a matter of time, that I really wouldn‚Äôt want to be with a person that abandoned me, that I dodged a bullet. 

Now I‚Äôm done with dating until I can figure out how to be happy by myself. But that‚Äôs turning out to be more difficult than I thought. I‚Äôve lost interest in everything. I don‚Äôt feel happy or even feel like myself when hanging out with my friends (I was an extrovert). I don‚Äôt crave anything (food/cooking used to be my hobby). Getting out of bed is hard bc I think about how he wronged me the second I wake up. My mind just feels lost. 

I‚Äôve been through breakups before. I worked out, cooked, wrote, joined a sorority, went out, made great girl friends, had a blast with them. This time feels so different. Therapy is good in general, but I don‚Äôt have the finances to comfortably support it. Any advice? Should I just really turn for medical help?"

I look in the mirror and don't even fucking recognize myself, and the loneliness is so fucking bad, so so bad and I can't fucking take it, I haven't genuinely talked to someone in 2 fucking years and I'm fucking losing it, I don't go to school and I don't work so I can't meet anyone and I think I'm just fucking ready to end it"
46,depression,Help for an empathetic psychopath?,"I'm gonna make this short and simple. Due to childhood and family trauma, I have different personalities where I organize different feelings. My main me is an anxious and depressed empath who wants harmony and peace in society. My doppelganger is psychopathic serial abuser, drugger, manipulator, prospective killer, and suicidal maniac. He has more than a dozen sexual harassment and assault victims. I have been firmly in control for the past couple years, and he's done some regrettable things but nothing prison worthy in that time. I've only recently become aware of his existence and most of his memories I had no recollection of. Every day I remember more and become more and more terrified of the monster inside of me. He can do anything and has no limits. He has every psychopathic tendency at once. 

I know I need help. A lot of help. The only therapists I've ever been to were religious gay conversion therapists that my parents sent me to as a kid, so I don't have the best reaction to therapy, but I need to push through it. I'm completely broke rn and going through a lot so I can't afford therapy if I wanted to. I can't ask my family for help because they'd inevitably send me to a religious counselor and I'd just gaslight my way out of it as usual. I can't ask my gf's family to pay for it because that's not fair and they have their own struggles to worry about. 

I really need help and I don't know where to look so here I am."
47,depression,Having a day scheduled to die,"Thoughts of having a day scheduled to die maybe in 5-10 years and during that time you would do your best with whatever *you're* interested, *you're* enjoying even if they're not considered as things worth doing or important by *experts* in the society.

Please don't be offended, I really want to know what you think of this idea ..... by experts I meant those who pretend to have a certain, solid reason for what we are doing on this random floating rock orbiting a star in a cold, dark space.

48,depression,car accident &amp; burnout,"Been through a lot of stress that culminated in a mental breakdown where I almost got into a car accident. After that I cried for an entire day while going to school and still having academic obligations. I have finally caught a break from school now, and at first I knew I was being lazy but now I feel this heavy exhaustion and anger. I have done nothing for 4 days, and I have pending deadlines that NEED to be met. I don‚Äôt feel the numb depressed feeling, I just feel angry and lazy. I have managed to make myself shower and still eat and function but I have things I want to get done but can‚Äôt perform properly. I just can‚Äôt get the energy to continue at any task I start and have been causing fights with family. I am so exhausted."
49,depression,Sometimes I Look Back and Hate Myself For What I've Done,"A few years ago my mother (who emotionally abuses me) took me out for a night on the town. We grabbed drinks and then she took me to see a concert.

I was so ungrateful that I had a shitty attitude all night long. I remember when the band was playing a song (I can't quite remember the name, but it was light and uplifting) I had a massive frown on my face the entire time.

Maybe this was her way of apologizing? Was she trying to make things right?

I'll never forgive myself for being so negative and sour. She wanted to do something fun with me, her only son, and I let my bad attitude spoil it.

I'm such a dickhead. I deserve the bad things that happen to me."
50,depression,I feel like a ghost,"Been a while since I went off of all social media and I feel a little like I don't exist irl just because I don't have an online presence. I don't feel seen by anyone, anywhere. Its so hard to connect with anyone. I feel like a background character everywhere. I honestly like it that way and don't want attention but it makes me feel unimportant. I have no close friends. I feel so starved for emotional support but there's no one."

53,depression,I booked a flight (other side of the world),More than 10y of depression and I STILL dont know how to manage it. I'm on my dark period right now I stopped working for months and on the paper I'm studying from home (UNI) but I didn't open a single pdf since the start of the year. I took my saving Less than 3k and booked a flight with the hope of feeling a bit better i'm leaving soon for a country that I like but i'm not that excited I used to travel a lot but this time i'm feeling NOTHING i'll just get on the plane and i'll see. I'll took my computer to see of i'll want to start studying(It will be a miracle). My mental health is a complete mess yesterday I took a shower cause the smell was just too much after 1month. I'LL come back with nothing but I HOPE to regain a bit of energy to take care of myself. I'm a female (29) a complete failure I didn't graduate from my studies yet cause I was never able to EITHER finish the year or start one. Worked part job never full time cause i just can't follow the rythm. SO that's it I just wanted to vant. Thanks
54,depression,I am sad. PLEASE help me.,"I'm sad. Please help me.

Backstory: my mom had me as a teenager. My biological dad and his parents all died (not sure whether this was before I was born or not). Mom married another dude and this man hates me.hes always hated me.i know it. My mom's whole family knows. Nothing could ever be done cos people had to protect my mother marriage.

Moved out at 23. We live on diff continents now. Still no relationship but they reached out to reconnect and hopefully help since I live in a country alone w no support system. Their families are in my city but they hate me for not getting pregnant young cos that's all they know and who do I think I am to escape that. So no relationship w them.

Turns out my mom didn't send her husband to reach out cos they wanted to help. They wanted to keep tabs on me to see how much I was failing since the pandemic has destroyed the 2 industries where I make a living. They wanted to gloat at how much I am a failure because I should've listened to them and rejected my dreams and opted to do life their way. Be in corporate and get a husband. Turns out my getting a husband was their only future plan for me.

Anyways: while working to make ends meet, my landlord had an affair and was kicked out of his house and I was evicted cos he needed to stay in my apartment. I packed my belongings into storage cos I've had a really tough year. I've had accident after another w broken bones, nursing myself back to health so I haven't worked this year as I was bed ridden. When I healed, I had to move. Flew across the world to visit my parents as my baby bro invited me for his graduation. I knew this was a bad idea but I'll do anything for my bro. The idea got worse cos now I'm no longer just a kid my mom's husband can abuse, now I can stand up for myself. My mom can't ever defend me, she has nothing. Standing up for me will leave her homeless cos she gave up her career to build his and today she's just broke w nothing to show for it. 

I have had the greatest career in the past decade. I kick ass. I am amazing. And talented w awards to boot for all my incredible work. I worked hard to build myself a home. Security. Something my mother failed to give me all my life. A safe space. I have failed multiple times in my life but I have always gotten up to fight. But not this time. I don't know how to get back up. I'm broken. All I do is cry. I don't have any money. A friend put me up in their vacant apartment. I have lost my purpose. I feel like I've lost everything. I'm broken. I don't know how to get up. I can't look for work cos I can't sit up for 5min without tears. All I've done in the 5 weeks in this apartment is allowed myself to be sad, feel it and allow myself to work through it but I need money to feed myself. 

The positives: I've been absolutely stress free for the first time in my life. It's such a big deal all the inflammation in my body is gone. I no longer need nasal surgery, my endometriosis has subsided, no anxiety or panic attacks. 

I need to work but I'm not finding the reason to motivate myself. It's getting very dark and suicidal and I don't want it to get there. 

I feel like I gave my everything to build my life. Dropped the ball once by having an accident and now I've lost my home. If I can't build a home and give myself some security, what am I working for? What is the point.

Someone help me!"

I go to classes and don't understand much, I wanna change it but I feel like it's a shame to do that. I feel like it's a shame I took a wrong decision. Going here makes me feel unmotivated, drained. I come home and cry for hours, this situation is also affecting my relationship. I try to hold my tears all day long. I feel weak, I feel like a failure.

65,depression,The apathy is terrifying,"I feel like a robot. Everything is falling apart but I can't care about it. It's as though depression is leaving no room for any emotion other than ""meh"". 

I've suffered depression since childhood but I have never before felt this level of apathy. What's different this time? What the hell is my brain gearing up for?"
66,depression,doubters,what do you tell people who say that depression isnt real?
67,depression,I finally accepted that I am completely alone,"I live alone, I work alone, I have no friends, but it never really clicked until last night that I really am alone. I'm introverted and I talk to myself and I spend a lot of time daydreaming so it's easy to ignore the loneliness for months at a time. I haven't even left my room in three days.

My family always wanted a normal son and never thought I could achieve anything in my life, but I am not normal and I will never live the life they want me to live and I refuse to give up on my dreams. So I moved as far away as possible as soon as possible and I only see them several times a year. I haven't achieved the life I want yet, but at least nobody's telling me what I can't do anymore.

There is nobody coming to help me, but there are plenty of people who will take advantage of me. I can't say how many times I've been screwed over in business and by friends. You can literally shake someone's hand and make a deal and the second they have to live up to their end, they betray you.

There will only ever be one person who will always be with me and that is myself so I may as well get used to my own company and try to help myself, because I can't be sure that anyone else will. There may be other people in my life, but I must always remember that I can't rely 100% on anyone. Friendships end, business people betray, lovers cheat.

It's a shame there isn't a way to know who you can trust, so I guess I just have to play the odds. I will always need people around me to work for, and eventually I will have to date and make friends in order to live the life I want. If I replace everyone I can't trust, eventually I'll have a network of people who are likely to be there for me, but I always need to remember that I'm the only one who will 100% be with me.

So I want to know how to be my own best friend first and do for myself what I would do for others. I can be a great friend to others, but I have difficulty helping myself because truthfully I don't like myself. Any advice is appreciated. Sorry for the rant."
68,depression,A nurse made me promise I wouldn‚Äôt kill myself today,"I recently went to the ER for self harm and had to call my primary doctor to set up an appointment for a medication change + talking about the whole ordeal at the hospital.

I contacted through a nurse first to explain what happened and see if I could get a earlier appointment than the one scheduled for two weeks from now. 

I have never met a nurse so personally worried for my well being. She talked to me on the phone and multiple times asked me not to kill or hurt myself before my appointment tomorrow morning. I kept reassuring her I wouldn‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm not uncomfortable with this at all, it was weirdly comforting. So, thank you to that nurse."

71,depression,Having a cold/flu and being depressed and anxious? Advice needed,"Hi all,

Recently I've been suffering with some mild COVID19 symptoms after testing positive last Thursday. I'm out of isolation tomorrow but over the last 3-4 days I would say that my mental health has taken a hit. I'm taking Escitalopram 10mg but was finding that was working well before my positive test for COVID. Over the last few days, I've been feeling down, anxious, restless, irritable, grumpy, you name it.  I also have little interest in doing things. It's almost like being ill has made my antidepressants stop working and I'm undergoing some kind of withdrawal. 

Does this feeling go away when I recover from this illness? I just feel so low at the moment, whereas I would say I felt pretty good before my test last Thursday."

And I know that my one friend in particular has depression and has considered ending his life. And he's spoken to me about his feelings because he trusts me. But all I can say is, ""it gets better"" and ""I understand how you feel"" because that's all anyone ever tells me. But I feel like most of them don't understand how desperate and lost I am. Like fuck I know it gets better but then it gets worse. I don't know what to do anymore."
76,depression,Lost and Alone,"I am a newly 17 Aussie (WA). This year my life has gone to shit. School and then work dumped me because of mental health issues that don‚Äôt have a label and won‚Äôt ever be diagnosed because I can‚Äôt get to therapy.

I‚Äôve applied for countless jobs, looked into TAFE courses, but with jobs I‚Äôm not qualified for anything and I can‚Äôt find a TAFE course I could actually finish.

I was supposed to finish a Cert III Animal Studies, but they kicked me out for a term and then dumped me in the dust when I was then falling behind. It‚Äôs still up in the air whether I will finish at all, not like I can get a job with it anyways.

My parents are done with me. They wasted so much money on me for me to turn out like a failure. They want me gone. My home life grows more unstable by the day.

They no longer want to support me and I have no money (because nobody will hire me, not even Maccas)

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I can barely get myself out of bed most days.
My Type One Diabetes is out of control and I‚Äôm fat and in pain.

I don‚Äôt have anyone in my life, no friends, no family, nothing.

Is it even worth trying anymore?
Is there even anything to salvage?"

I‚Äôm so alone just existing for the sake of it the loneliness is eating me up I can‚Äôt seem to look at myself and feel useful. I feel like this world has nothing for me. It‚Äôs like nothing is waiting for me in the future. I don‚Äôt want to survive this time I really don‚Äôt I rather best be dead and observe everyone live there life and be happy. I hate myself and never want to be alive again. Idk who will find this but thanks for being in my life. I've also been feeling extremely suicidal lately, I can't take this total isolation anymore. Even if I have an opportunity to talk to someone at all, I can barely even manage to form a sentence. Never mind a girl. Stutter, stutter fkn stutter. Even if I have something in mind I find it so difficult to actually say it. Who on earth would have the patience to listen to me? Even if I tried to talk to someone how could they ever be attracted to me? I can't even talk to them properly.

I'm so crippled with anxiety I can't even go outside or talk to someone online anymore. Sure I'll comment here and there, but I can't actually have a conversation or form any kind of friendship and relationship.
Goodbye.

Have to say thanks to the people who constantly reached out to me and on posts these couple of weeks it did seem like I was not taking it in but I sure did that‚Äôs why I was and am still here not anymore now."
78,depression,I dont know who I am,"I dont know what i like or what i dislike. nothing i do brings me joy like i say i enjoy reading but i dont actually feel anything when i read. Its just another thing I do that helps me forget about reality for a bit. I chose the subjects i study because i'm good at them, not because i enjoy them. My walls are pink not because its my favourite colour but because when the light hits them there's a warm hue in my room which makes me feel safe.

I dont know what I look like. Every time I look in the mirror I see someone else. Often I dont recognise the person in the mirror. I know my hair is washed out ginger and I have hazel eyes and my nose is pointy but those features dont feel like me. 
I know I'm taller than average but I feel small around some people. Some people make me look slim and others make me look fat. Who am I when I'm not comparing myself to others?

I always adopted traits from the people I surrounded myself with and that kind of gave me a sense of identity but now that i'm all alone i have nothing. who am i when i'm not being perceived by others?"

Everything is so mundane and hard. I don't have a job because the thought of it cripples me. I rarely leave my house, other than walking my dog once a day, I haven't seen my family in over 2 months. I stay in bed until midday and some days can't even get out of bed at all. Nothing excites me or interests me, I just have no reason to keep going with this I can't believe I have another 60 odd years of this I already feel like I'm done. I've been on Trintellix 5mg for 2 weeks and all it's done is increase my anxiety. I don't even know what I'm looking for posting this, maybe it's just my way of ranting or hopefully someone can relate. I just needed to write it out as I don't really have anyone to tell this to"

I have even questioned whether I‚Äôm actually dumb or what‚Äôs the case, it‚Äôs my 6th time!!! I can‚Äôt pass it I have tried everything study by myself study in classes studied online read books.

82,depression,How to feel better if you don't?,"Sometimes I feel trapped because I don't know how to make myself feel better. Somehow it seems if you want to feel good then you already must feel that way a little bit. I don't know if that makes sense. Instead you get stuck in this cycle of not wanting to do anything you think would help you and feeling worse for it.

I keep thinking and thinking. Wondering how I can solve these problems of mine.

85,depression,Am I depressed?,"I sleep a lot on my days off. There are many things happening in my life. I‚Äôm confused. 

Everyday I convince myself that I‚Äôm lucky I have a good job and I make decent money to afford my house and other expenses. 

I live alone. My parents are gone. My family (brother, sister, nieces, and nephews) contacts me from overseas to ask for money. I send some when I can. They sometimes make me feel guilty if I don‚Äôt send any. 

I grew up poor. My family never helped me. I moved to another country to better myself. 

I have family here but I don‚Äôt talk to them. 

I feel alone but I tell myself that I have managed to live alone for many years already. I gamble at the casino when I feel lonely. I max out my credit cards and then feel depressed after that and then I go back to work overtime to pay my credit cards and then gamble again. 

When I‚Äôm home with mo cash to gamble, I sleep a lot. I just eat and sleep and then wake up to go work. 

I‚Äôm a good worker and I do my job really well. Matter of fact, I‚Äôm the most reliable employee. I don‚Äôt bring my personal feelings at work. I‚Äôm lively and productive at work. 

I don‚Äôt make friends with my coworkers though. I just work and clock out and go on with my own personal life after work. 

At home, that‚Äôs when depression hits. I don‚Äôt wanna go see a professional coz I know they‚Äôll give me some meds and I don‚Äôt wanna do that. I can handle this myself. 

I tried distracting myself by enrolling into a grad program. Halfway through the program, I quit. I think it made my anxiety worst. I can finish school pretty good but the pressure of turning in assignments and projects was a little too much for me. 

I don‚Äôt really need to do that kind of schooling. I can just go online and learn things at my own pace. I feel like grad school is just another money making scheme.

I could probably live with my dad for a month if I had to but after that it would be the streets.  I currently am self employed and resell college textbooks as well as collectibles and occasionally fix up a motorcycle and sell it.

I just want to get to a point where I can provide for myself well enough so that I can focus on beating my depression I dont need to thrive. Right now I just want to make enough to live.

I‚Äôm in my early twenties and have a toddler. I always wanted to be a mom. But now I‚Äôm so bitter and depressed all the time. My anxiety is through the roof most days. I have hyperthyroidism which can cause anxiety so my dr told me they wouldn‚Äôt prescribe any anxiety meds until my thyroid levels were okay. Months later and they‚Äôre the same I still have no medication to help my mental health. I feel hopeless like no one understands me or takes me seriously. I feel like I‚Äôm failing  all around.

99,depression,Depression management from lifestyle changes alone?,"I've been trying various medications (Various SSRIs, SNRI, and Wellbutrin) over the years now and it seems like
there's either no benefit to taking these medications or the side effects are even worse than the symptoms associated with my Depression and Anxiety. Did anyone get out of a depression rut through lifestyle changes (exercise, diet, etc.) without the use of medications? I'm really struggling with fatigue and
hypersomnia and there doesn't seem to be issues with my blood work."
100,depression,&lt;3 A lonely rant about 'loneliness' &lt;3,"Sometimes I wonder if I have anyone.

I know I do but maybe it doesn't always feel like it idk.

I guess I just wish I knew what it was like to have someone that's always there for you. Someone to encourage you and to rely on. Someone who will sit there, listen to you cry, tell you that you're gonna be okay, and to remember that the pain is only temporary.

I wonder what it's like to have someone wipe your tears away when you can't stop crying or to hug you so tight you're forced to take a breath, sit with you just because you need the company.

Sometimes I feel like being lonely is a sickness, Something that cripples my body, continuously aches inside me. I know it's there but no matter how hard I try nobody has answers and I am never any closer to finding out a cure. The worse it gets, the more desperate I become, giving into half assed back alley work which only ever seems to make it worse. 

The realization that nothing is working and that no matter what you do, it's not gonna go away.

Staring out at everyone else just existing, that one person with friends they've known since they were 6 yrs old, turned into now highschool sweethearts that feel like a cheesy movie no one would ever believe could actually come true.

Watching two people hold hands and skip through the store like idiots just because...

Or a group friends in the car all singing backstreet boys as loud as they can because it's cringe and abnoxious but life is too short so who tf cares. 

Sitting around and talking about serious shit most of you know nothing about but you all think you're somehow the only people on planet earth who are smarter than the rest of the world.

Inside joke after inside joke without any hesitation.

Trying to rap to random beats that just end in you all laughing until you cry because the raps are so shit.

Literally just chilling by a fire and eating s'mores with the stars in the sky, crickets the fill the silence and the cozy flame that makes you feel right at home in that shitty lawn chair you keep in the trunk just in case.

Sometimes I believe I'll find this one day... And then sometimes I don't, idk. 

I'm just tired of waking up everyday, knowing the day has so much potential only to be disappointed by how hard I try to make it different but it ends up feeling exactly the same.

I don't want to deal with the trauma, the triggers, the panic attacks, the emptiness I feel when I'm struggling and no one is ever around, wishing I had someone to call who would just listen and talk to me. Someone I could trust and know that they care and aren't just manipulating me for their own personal gain. Someone I know who wants me around regardless of the constant struggle, the tears, the pain, the paranoia, and impulsiveness or weird/odd things about me like wanting to build shit with Legos, playdough, K'nex, popsicle sticks... Spontaneously wanting to go to the trampoline park and then realizing I'm too scared to attempt any tricks. Or maybe just sitting out on the balcony wearing a fluffy sweater in the cold autumn weather because it makes me feel all cozy inside.


I hope everyday that it's not true... but maybe I really am the only one.. because if I wasn't, then why am I still alone."

I don't remember much, seems like it was very easy to just... slip away. Suddenly I was awake and in pain and vomiting as paramedics revived me. My friend had given me several shots of narcan and I didn't respond so he called 911.

Ever since I've been pretty messed up in the head, both thinking about how easy and calm it was, and wishing I hadn't been revived. It's shown me that the part of this I've feared most can actually be peaceful. While I am not planning suicide, I've always felt it's how I would go, and now I'm a little more sure of it. I don't know when it will happen, but it's getting close."

109,depression,invisible disability,"I'll try to be as brief as possible. honestly probably don't even bother reading it it's just a vent post about feeling invisible.

I (24) suffer from diagnosed treatment resistant depression, cptsd, and gad. I got away from my abusers when I just turned 21, unfortunately I fell right into a different kind of abuser, and then I was in a youth homeless shelter for 2 months, and then I had like an assisted living youth apartment thing for about 6 months until I lost the fifth job due to my crippling mental illness, and I went and lived with another abusive person for about a year and I got my 6th 7th and 8th job while I was living there all of them I ended up getting fired for basically being unable to work because if I actually tried to work I would break down and literally cry and like have an anxiety attack. my seventh job actually paid somewhat decently and I ended up getting kicked out of this person's home just as I got it I had support from my SMI clinic to help me get like a normal apartment and help me pay rent for the first couple of months I lived there for about 6 months before I was hospitalized for 12 days after trying to kill myself, I came home I worked that next week and then I simply could not work anymore the thought doing pretty much anything was so dreadful that I couldn't get out of bed most days much less work I simply laid in bed and distracted myself with like YouTube or sleep and that's pretty much all I did until I was officially fired on December 10th after that job refused to work with me and my issues at that time I had also run out of the savings I had made and despite my best efforts I wasn't able to come up with rent I got an eviction notice and on the final day before I would be evicted I was intending on becoming a statistic, but for some reason I contacted crisis and ended up back in the hospital for 22 days and after that I've been living in like a housing program kind of thing obviously now we're at like the end of September I have tried several times to get a job or really do anything but have been just unable, but my housing program love to ask me about what my plans are in getting a job and moving out and stuff as though they had done literally anything to help me over the last many months I tried to get my clinic to help me apply for disability but they basically refused to help me apply because I had had jobs before even though I have literally not worked in over a year at this point and very seriously doubt being able to do so anytime soon.

I just I wish my issues were physical I wish people could see them nobody I interact with on a daily basis understands what it's like to just constantly be in physical emotional and mental pain I slept like 20 hours a day every single day in August due to summertime SAD, luckily that is slightly going away now I'm almost at my baseline of everything I just don't know what to do. none of the professionals that I deal with really seem to understand none of them could do anything either way I try to make friends talking in like local internet groups but I can't explain to them in a way that they understand that I can't go anywhere I have absolutely no money nobody can come over to where I live cuz I live in a housing program I just feel so isolated and like nobody actually cares I just don't know what to do anymore. I think the worst part is that I feel like I could do some sort of job of some kind I could be quote unquote productive but I would lose my Medicare and I would have to pay rent and utilities and this that and the other with basically minimum wage at super low hours in a job that just abuses me which is just literally not something that I can do if I actually got a job, assuming they could look past the fact that I tell them up front that I have crippling fucking mental illnesses I wouldn't be able to do it. I feel like if I didn't have to worry about all of the just everything collapsing around me as soon as I try to get a job that I could like volunteer or something but I don't have any options for that I don't have any way to go anywhere I have hours of obligation to redundant mental health lecture bullshit things every single day everyone just wants to waste my time and suck as much money out of ""treating me"" as possible I don't know I feel like I've rambled enough yeah that's it I guess"

I get why they think it cowardly, but all I ever hear from people is how they always choose the easy path through life. 

People only pick the hard option when they have no option to choose from. It's hypocritical, even though I know they don't mean it that way.

Doing small things is hard, but I get zero satisfaction from getting out of bed or taking a shower. I'm not convinced going to work or finding a partner will be satisfying either.

Nothing less than a huge upheaval in my life will work and I'm not even convinced of that. I only believe that because it's wild to think a massive change of every part of my life wouldn't help me feel better. 

Suicide is sooooo much easier. It's guaranteed to satisfy."

123,depression,Feeling stuck and extremely bitter,"I've suffered from several mental illnesses my whole life, depression being one of them. I had to finish college at home during the pandemic. It took me 5.5 agonizing years but I finally graduated, but no satisfaction followed that, it felt stolen from me. I closed my laptop on the last day, and walked 2 feet to my bed, and that was it. No ceremony, no anything.

What really stung was how most people I was constantly there for and was close with in college all but completely abandoned me. One particular friend turned hostile towards me before they moved away. 

On top of all that, on and off for a few years throughout all this I was seeing a girl that treated me like shit. I had to break us up on her behalf when I finally got her to admit she just didn't like me that much.

I guess to wrap this all up, I feel like I get used and thrown out, over and over again, regularly throughout my life. I wish I could vent my frustration to these peoples faces about how they treated me, but thats not really who I am. I'm a pushover, and I have no self esteem. I blame myself and my mental health for why people don't like me. Of course they're all successful doing their own things now, and I feel stuck in a rut without  current employment and tons of anxieties holding me back. It all feels unfair and I'm just bitter about it, I wish I could just move on, but the anger and depression stays.

Anyways, since I was put on prozac, about three months ago, I have had dreams every fucking night. I literally do not understand how people live like this, having dreams and shit.
It's absolutely awful and I don't know what tp do about it. I know I dont like the dreams, and sometimes I'll wake up crying, but I can't even tell if they would be classified as nightmares, because they're nothing like the nightmares I tend to get. (for example, the past few have been my mother was a murderous excorcist, my house was invaded by squirrells, my grandma showed up and I was bit by a turtle, an entire history of mass genocide in a nonexistent country) I genuinely cant tell if they are nightmares and I have an actual issue to work through here, or if they are normal dreams and I'm just not acclimated

So today I decided to get up and clean my depression room. With a positive mindset I started cleaning, took a break, then went back.

That was the first time I had ever seen something like this in my room so I disposed of them ( searched on Google how) and cleaned up after. 
 Even though my room is clean, my closet is a whole nother story. I know I have some old food in there along with ( not proud ) very very dirty pieces of clothes. It‚Äôs a horror in there and I don‚Äôt even want to check if there‚Äôs maggots.

I was wondering if there‚Äôs some sort of cleaning service I can get to clean my closet out ( people similar to the hoarder shows cleaners ). Because I feel deeply ashamed of this and really don‚Äôt want to ask for help from my mother. Not that she would even help if I asked her."

136,depression,TW : Self harm - attention or something more,"Do you keep it a secret? Or do you make it obvious and use it as a way to communicate that you‚Äôre struggling to your loved ones? 


Long story short : I have dabbled in self harm over the years usually burning because I am very conscious of not wanting it to be obvious and I find burns are the easiest to give excuses for. 

When I reflect on the times I have burnt myself I wonder at the reasons I did. I tend to think SH as a release - the pain distracts and cuts through the heightened emotions I am usually feeling at the time and gives me clarity and calm. Kind of like the shock of cold water to wake you up when drowsy, the shock of pain and associated adrenaline seems to ‚Äúburn‚Äù out everything else. 

I know some people do it for punishment or because they feel they deserve it or for many other reasons but usually I do it for the sensation and the accompanied calm. 

I have recently started taking some pills - not in a ‚Äúself harm‚Äù way (although I acknowledge it probably still counts) but I do it for the same purpose of overpowering the other feelings I am experiencing. 

Both the physical SH and the pills is something that I hide because I fear the judgement and misunderstanding that will come with telling anyone. I am not doing it for their attention or acknowledgement but rather to get some relief from ‚Äúnoise‚Äù in my brain (aka emotions and thoughts) 

Does this make it worse/more dangerous?"
137,depression,"I used to post here a lot, then everything improved, and 5 year later I'm back.","I was extremely depressed. I would spend my time alone writing in my journal, filling many pages a night expressing my feelings. I'd fill up entire books and then light them on fire, tear them apart, or drown them for a cathartic release.

I would make posts on here explaining how I felt, and how lost I was.

Then I met someone who changed my life. A mother of 2 who I immediately felt comfortable with. Things progressed and eventually she moved in with me. Her oldest was 6 and the youngest just 1 yr old.

I was scared. I wasn't sure if I could handle it. I didn't have any kids of my own, I never had even held a child. But their mother made me so happy, and immediately took my depression away. It's like when we met, my lows elevated to just normal 'bad days'. It was like magic. I loved her immediately for that.

I have my own problems from past traumas, and I'm not a perfect partner by any means. But I decided I was going to go all in on being the best partner and co-parent I could. For 3 years, every decision I made and nearly every thought I would have was based around the question ""Is this good for my partner or is it good for the children long term?""

I devoted my life to them. I potty trained the youngest. I taught the oldest how to read, study, and do math.

I have a loving family, but until this point I had never come close to feeling the kind of love I felt for these children.

The youngest gave me a little pink bracelet of stars when she was around 4 yrs old. I've worn it every moment of every day since, as a reminder of what I'm working hard for.

This was my primary focus for 5 years. 

About a month ago, I found out that my partner was cheating on me. I confronted her about it and her response was to tell me how she was unhappy with me and then she took her kids and left. I haven't seen them since.

One morning I'm waking up playing with kids, goofing around and having fun with them, and the next night I'm sitting in my home alone and knowing that I'm never going to see them ever again. 

5 years or finally being happy. I would wake up every day feeling so grateful that the deep emptiness I once felt was gone. So glad to finally feel like I had a purpose and to finally feel pure happiness.

For nearly 10 years prior to meeting my ex, I spent almost every night writing about how unhappy I was. Almost every night going over the pros and cons of just ending my life.


And I've forgotten all of those feelings. And it's all come rushing back to me, and ontop of it all, I've lost the people that I have loved the most in my entire life.

I will never see 'my daughters' next birthday, let alone the day she graduates. I will never get to see 'my sons' first sports game or help him build his first computer.

This life is so unbearably cruel.

I am so scared of the future. Everything was so much harder before. And now I'm back to square one but with the additional weight of having lost everything I had devoted my life to.

Every night I'm alone and no matter how bad I feel, there is no one to comfort me. I'm in so much pain."

Mom is verbally abusive. Dad is as well but he mainly doesn‚Äôt give a shit these days.
My mom is unbearable to live with. She‚Äôs telling me I should starve myself and constantly making threats. The only reason I‚Äôm here is cause of my sisters. They‚Äôre my only reason for living. I hate myself so much and I wish my mom would love me like a mother should. I know there‚Äôs no point sulking about it cause she has narcissistic tendencies. I just wish things were different."
139,depression,I am afraid my mindset is keeping me from making progress. Do I get depression wrong?,"Hello guys
It would mean the world if you could offer me some advice regarding my mindset or sharing some personal experience.

I (F28) am diagnosed with depression for ten years and with BPD for seven years.
The BPD is pretty much under control by now (thank god!!) but the depression isn‚Äôt.
I am not sure it was like this over those ten years that I‚Äôve battling with depression, but for at least half, I feel insanely tired.

This is important, I promise.

Over the last years, I probably didn‚Äôt have one month, adding up, that I felt energized, enthusiastic about anything for more than five minutes or just plain normal.

It‚Äôs hard to shower, to brush my teeth, to get out of bed, to go outside, to talk to people. It‚Äôs hard to do everything, even things I like.

I am taking my meds and seeing my psychiatrist regularly. I also do therapy.

My doctor is super nice and I don‚Äôt plan to switch, it took me forever to find a good match. But once in a while, she says things that make me question everything.

I will give some examples:
She says I need routine to get better. But this makes me wanna cry in frustration, because I can‚Äôt do it. The way I see it, it‚Äôs the other way around. As soon as I feel better, routine will come back naturally. This is how it worked when I had ups over the last years.

She also says that if I don‚Äôt do something, it means I am boycotting myself.
Ok, sometimes. But always?
Is it so hard to believe I can‚Äôt do things ?

I don‚Äôt know. I am confused. I wanna cry.
Am I being lazy or am I really impaired? I feel so tired. I just wanna rest.

What if I am not doing enough to get better?
Is it my fault I am wasting my life? It breaks my heart. I loved so many things. I wanted to do so much."
140,depression,"Bruh, I just can‚Äôt","Just why? Why does it always come down to this? I take my meds, I socialize, I call my siblings, I hand out in person, I play games with friends. And yet, it always ends with me feeling alone, suicidal, isolated, not needed, not wanted, out of energy, and ready to see what‚Äôs next. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anyMore.

I try really hard to keep everything a joke, keep it in perspective, focus on the good. Yet even when it feels good I‚Äôm just waiting for it to get bad again. Strangely when it gets bad is the only time I feel at ease, cause at least it won‚Äôt get worse.

I go to therapy, I manage meds with a shrink, and yet I always end up here. How many more times do I have to do this before I can finally call it quits and say I have it my best try?"
141,depression,"I was playing a game and pulled off a nice play, said 'sheeesh' died a few seconds later and asked ""Why am I so bad?""","Less serious but I thought the contrast was pretty funny

I guess this demonstrates how irrational depression can be sometimes"

143,depression,I just want to be happy,Saying this out loud makes me tear up because I know I probably never will be.
144,depression,Soon,I‚Äôm such a horrible person. All I do is hurt everyone around me. Why can‚Äôt I just be good for something? Why can‚Äôt I be normal? When will it end. I am tired of being here. It‚Äôs like I can never do anything right. My life has so little ups but so many downs. I have nothing and no one to live for. In all honesty I think everyone would be better off without me. I just don‚Äôt have the fucken balls to kill myself. One day I will though. One day I will be strong enough to end all of this pain.

146,depression,I'm no longer entertained,"I've probably posted the same sorta thing before lol but I don't really care. 

I can't find a single thing to entertain me anymore, and I've tried a lot of shit. Games are all the same and are no fun. I can still play them for hours but it almost feels like I'm on auto pilot and just passing time. 
All my hobbies are just dull at this point. I got into playing cards recently but that got old quickly because I have no one to play with. I'm tired of scrolling through the internet and only talking to people over the internet. The only hobby of mine that I actually stick with is working out, because I have a decent physique and I'd like to at least keep it like that or improve it a bit. 
I dunno, literally the only thing that entertains me is being with friends but outside of my friend group I feel so goddamn alone. I do not live close to any friends and it's rare that I get a chance to hang out, outside of school. 

I'm sure nobody read this lol. Either way I just needed to rant to something, and I didn't wanna burden my friends with my bs. Yeah ima go back to dying inside lol"

148,depression,Who can I trust?,"I learned I can‚Äôt even trust my wife. I have nobody to talk to or vent to anymore. I‚Äôve been really struggling and having some bad thoughts lately.

I thought I could open up to my wife and tell her some of the dark thoughts I‚Äôve had lately in terms of hurting myself and my father in law asked me if I was okay then felt the need to check up on me a couple days later, she claims she didn‚Äôt mention anything to him.

A couple of my family members felt the need to call me and ask if I was doing okay less than a week later, again she claims she didn‚Äôt say anything to them.

Her coworker even ‚Äúwanted to talk to me‚Äù but she claims she didn‚Äôt say anything to her outside of saying ‚Äúhe‚Äôs stressed out‚Äù

I know it‚Äôs all bullshit

I know she‚Äôs been talking about the issues i have asked her to keep private. She knows I‚Äôm looking for help, I‚Äôve asked her to keep my issues between us and to just let me find outside help on my own, I‚Äôve asked her to not mention anything I say to anybody we know.

I‚Äôve had to lie to family more in the past 2 weeks than I have in the past 30 years.

I‚Äôm tired of saying ‚Äúno I‚Äôm fine just a little overwhelmed‚Äù or ‚Äúyeah no I‚Äôm just a little stressed out with shit‚Äù

I can‚Äôt trust anybody anymore, I have nobody to talk to anymore. I can‚Äôt trust her anymore.

I feel so dead inside, I feel emotionless, I can‚Äôt even sleep.

I can‚Äôt even confide in my wife about shit I‚Äôm going through without everybody in our family knowing about it!

All it did is make things worse.

I was clinically diagnosed with PTSD and I don‚Äôt want to discuss it with everybody, I really don‚Äôt even want to talk about it but I trusted her. I can‚Äôt even do that now‚Ä¶

Shits been really hard and I don‚Äôt know what to do about it"

151,depression,I'm tired.,"Im just really tired of life and im waiting for it to end. I barely smile anymore. ive lost all motivation to keep going and push forward. Ive felt like ive done everything ive wanted in my life. I just cant keep on going. I feel apathetic to everything. Im way to tired to do anything anymore. I just dont give a shit anymore. I don't enjoy none of my hobbies. The only good thing i have left are my friends. They are the only thing stopping me from ending it all, they are the only thin that genuinelymakes me laugh but only for a few hours, once they aren't there Im back to being tired. It feels like the end for me, can't see myself in the future being happy or even alive. School started again and I‚Äôve been stressing out what I‚Äôm going to do with my fucking life. I dont know if i can keep up with my grades and I don't know if I can do this for another year or two. I just want this shit to end, I want to be happy, I want to rest. I hate this shit."
152,depression,my life isnt even hard im just a bitch,"my life is literally so easy. im born in a first world country in a middle class family. my parents are great. i have 0 childhood trauma. i did well in school. 

but what the fuck is going on now? im in my room all day. i have clinical depression and i dont even want to get better. i want to die. i know im an ungrateful entitled asshole. i want to die because i dont want to change."
153,depression,My gf flirts with other people while being apathetic towards me. All while saying she's not good enough for me. Yet I still can't leave her.,"There are definitely reasons I am with her still. The times she's not apathetic she's outstandingly loving and makes me feel better than ever before.

But, the majority of the reason is that I don't think I'm good enough for anyone. So, the fact that I'm good enough for anyone, let alone someone as amazing as her makes me feel like I got unbelievably lucky and like I'll never get this luck again.

So, I continue with her. She ""unintentionally"" flirts with other guys even after I've mentioned it makes me feel shitty and I only express displeasure. She tells me she's unsure if she wants to commit any effort to the relationship and I ignore it. She says she's not sure if she has a desire to be with me and I ignore it still.

I've come to the conclusion that this is because I feel like I have no real attractive qualities and would end up with no one to embrace, left out in the cold, alone and sad if I left her."
154,depression,Empty,"I don‚Äôt think I can go for much longer. I drink and numb myself every day and go through the motions. When people talk to me at work I can see their mouths moving but nothing is computing in my head. I just smile and nod because that‚Äôs the easy thing to do. Drugs, therapists, I just don‚Äôt really see a light anymore. I‚Äôm not depressed, just empty. I‚Äôm going to keep trying, but I feel like I‚Äôm just prolonging the inevitable."
155,depression,am I the problem?,"I'm currently overthinking about all the problems that's happened in my friend group, it's all coming down on me and I don't know what to do. I keep going back and replaying memories in my head, thinking about what I did wrong. The main reason a problem starts is because I don't know how to talk to others, I've never really been able to be straight forward with something. There are times that somethingnis going on and i dont know what to say and i just stay quiet, or i want to say something but nothjng comes out.I try and try but it never works, I continue to blame my disability (aspergers) but I don't even know if it's that anymore. I'm slowly loosing my friend group and I don't want that, I want to try and distance myself but I'll only feel lonely. I want to talk and be serious with them about why I've been acting this way but the truth is I don't know myself, when I don't say anything they get mad and I apologize. I'm currently laying in my bed replaying every problem that's happened in the friend group, I've come to the conclusion that they all connect back to me, every single one. I'm listening to the voice in my head berate me saying that I don't deserve friends and I deserve nothing, maybe he's right.
I want to cry but the tears won't come. I want a hug but I can never ask. I want help but I'll only feel bad asking for it. I want to vent but the words don't come out.  I'm scared I'm on the verve of losing everything that made me whole.
Another thing is I'm making my girlfriend miserable. We've been together 2 years now and I've noticed I do the same with her, I don't know what to do. I'm terrible at relationships,  especially since one girl I was dating killed herself, she's ended up in a coma and forgot everything for a while. We still talk which is good, but I can't help but blame myself for it all, being as it I wasn't able to help or stop her, was I the reason she did it? Was I putting on alot of pressure? I don't know about anything anymore. 
I need to know, is it all my fault?
Do I have that bad of luck or is it just my poor decision making?"
156,depression,I‚Äôve had enough,I can‚Äôt do this anymore. I beat depression and life stressors then they return. I want love then find someone new then it doesn‚Äôt go well. I worked hard. I proved myself and made good money. I feel no reason to stay here anymore. It‚Äôs time to accept maybe there‚Äôs no reason to. I can‚Äôt live like this anymore.

I try to be the medium of the family and help out but they always push there‚Äôs feelings and emotions on to me. It‚Äôs getting to much.
161,depression,I am practicing death lol,"Ya sounds weird, either ur dead or alive.

I guess I am in the middle. Kind of overdosed on some meds. But I knew I will wake up. I am trying to figure out what dosage will totally knock me out for ever.

First time I tried , I slept straight 15hrs.

Second time 24hrs.


Hmm ... I definitely don't want to build tolerance.


I have to figure a dose that will be the end of me and peaceful sleep.

Waking up after 24hrs , just felt so good. Like I finally rested for a bit.


I wish I never wake up.

I am planning to end it during the holidays, that way, my family has holiday vacation to get organized,  mourne me and return back to life again in 2023.


Let them have a fresh start for 2023.  I am no use to them  now days.  I have helped them as much as I can.


Now ,, I feel like a burden . I am ready , I am tired of the hope, and tired of trying different ways to get better ,


You know what for some ppl it just does not get better.


Imagine a person who lost his leg, no matter what he does, his leg won't grow back. Or a person who lost there ability to see .

No transplant will let him see again. Nothing will bring back the sight.

Just like that nothing will fix my depression , no matter how hard I try , i cannot get better.

Same with the person  who lost their legs they cannot grow another leg, but they have to accept they don't have legs and learn to adapt and live a life without leg.


I guess being depressed,  kind of the same , learn to live with depression and do everything u can to function with depression.

Now days, becoming just impossible to function. I got a taste of nothingness and I want to go back.

Whatever rest I got from the nothingness felt good.

I want to stay there and thats its. I don't wsnt to exist  , I just want to be unborn , whatever that state is, I want to have never existed ."

163,depression,Another day where husband just stays in bed,"We'd been planning to take the kids to a pumpkin patch today. Everyone had been looking forward to it. Then my husband and I had a minor disagreement this morning (really, we were mildly annoyed with each other for about two minutes), and now he's staying in bed. He's not coming with us. The kids will still have fun I'm sure, but I don't know how to cope with this anymore sometimes. It's hard to talk to him about it because it will reinforce his belief that we'd all be better off without him. It's also hard just to keep it in because I know it will happen again and it just makes me sad and angry.
Not sure what I'm looking for. Some empathy I guess, and advice."
164,depression,What can I do for my depressed partner?,"My boyfriend and I are going through a very rough patch. Not because there's a lack of love but he hasn't been the same since months. First he was complaining about feeling burned out and stressed but I didn't take it that seriously at this time (ca. 3 months ago). Little did I know it would get way worse after that and his burnout would eventually turn into a really bad depression. Everyone handles their depression individually, I know. Unfortunately he feels most comfortable whenever he's alone and needs a lot of distance from people. But because I'm also carrying very heavy weights on my shoulders (family issues and my own depressive + anxiety episodes) it's very hard for me to understand that he's not pushing me away because he doesn't want to be with me. He told me several times that he's not capable of doing anything at the moment and that he can't meet my needs right now because he can barely meet his own. I understand that but at the same time I feel unloved and anxious. I miss the person he used to be and it pains me a lot. I often mistake his egoistic behaviour for one of his personality traits and forget that it's not actually him but rather his mental illness speaking. I really don't know what to do or how to help him. Everything I tried didn't really work out and we ended up being more frustrated with each other than before. We even talked about a possible break up but then decided to keep trying because our love for each other is not dead at all. I truly care for him and he cares for me. There's just something in his head that keeps blocking everything. We compromised and agreed that I should learn how to be more patient without giving him any pressure and he should at least try to get out of his cacoon from time to time to kind of ""nourish"" the relationship more with love and kindness. I think it's also very important to mention that I suffer from an anxious attachment style which makes distance even harder for me. I hope I can learn some new things here to improve myself and the relationship I'm in. Thanks for reading and eventually commenting :)"

I didn‚Äôt say anything to that and we just kept talking.

Is this how she always feels deep down? Is this something Depression makes you think? I really want to talk to her about it and assure her that I like having her in my life. Would it be okay to ask why tf she‚Äôd think I want to leave?

I wish i could just forget about all the trauma and pain and everything that makes me want to turn to substances but i cant.

176,depression,I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore,"Back in 2020 I (male) was living in a foreign country away from home (Australia) for about two years. When the pandemic hit we had to move back in a hurry. At that point I had just made real friends and people that I was growing really close to. I was in my first year of high school at that point. I moved back to Australia after not being able to go to school for a whole year and not having a real place to call home. Just moving between different houses until my family eventually found somewhere to settle down. Over the last two years I have been in several groups moved schools again and life could not have gone any worse for how I planned. Got into fights with others I had just met after a ton of racist hate in my first term of school. Kicked out and made fun of by my group. Eventually so bad I had to leave and go to a new school. 

I had what people call a glow up. I used to be on the bigger side and had terrible skin. I grew a ton and got my skin sorted out as well as worked out so I started to get a lot more attention. It started to get to my head the more fun I was having. However as I would get into a new group of mutual friends I had from my old school it became apparent to me that everyone had been friends for years and I just didn‚Äôt fit in at all. Subconsciously I started to change in my personality and the way I acted to be more liked, chasing friendship. This would result in my downfall because now I don‚Äôt know who I am. I‚Äôve become a background character in everyone‚Äôs lives and don‚Äôt have any friends that would even consider me to be anywhere at 5th to 6th in their circle. The people I now value the most out of my friends just see me as another mate who‚Äôs just there. I don‚Äôt know who I‚Äôve become now chasing other peoples approval and I hate the person I‚Äôve become. 


How do I find my old self?

It doesn't help that I'm inherently afraid of everyone. It's so hard to come out of my shell when I can't even think straight when talking to anyone. 

But I wasn't always like this. There was a time in my life where I was super outgoing and had no trouble making friends. But trauma, I think, fucked me up.

Can people sense my anxiety or am I just that fucking awful? That no one even wants to say hi to me?

I genuinely don't know if I should live anymore. Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm already too far gone to ever make a life for myself. Could there be a day where I look forward to tomorrow?

I've been alone for so long I can't even talk to anyone. Not even just romantic loneliness (I've never been loved) but loneliness in general. I don't even have friends.

I've also been feeling extremely suicidal lately, I can't take this total isolation anymore. Even if I have an opportunity to talk to someone at all, I can barely even manage to form a sentence. Never mind a girl. Stutter, stutter fkn stutter. Even if I have something in mind I find it so difficult to actually say it. Who on earth would have the patience to listen to me? Even if I tried to talk to someone how could they ever be attracted to me? I can't even talk to them properly.

I'm so crippled with anxiety I can't even go outside or talk to someone online anymore. Sure I'll comment here and there, but I can't actually have a conversation or form any kind of friendship and relationship.
I‚Äôve tried everything in person dating apps I get the numbers and then they just ghost me. I look around and see couples holding hands cuddling and so on and I just come back to my place alone and I‚Äôm¬† thinking of ending it soon not because of this just because this life is annoying."
187,depression,how real is my depression,"im 17. i have wonderful parents. i have zero childhood trauma. ive never dealt with the loss of a loved one. ive never been abused in any way. i was a high achiever at school. i wasnt too social but people liked me in highschool bc i was somewhat attractive. ive had people ask me out. my family is not rich but not poor. i live in a first world country. 

am i just going through an edgy teenager phase? i ended up dropping out of school and i became the family disappointment. i was supposed to do well and go to med school. make my parents proud. but now ive been diagnosed with clinical depression. i am suicidal. i am an utter failure in that regard. 

but seriously, my life is fucking amazing compared to others. do i even have the right to be depressed. am i just being spoilt? just so self centred and entitled and wallowing in selfpity like a pathetic loser."
188,depression,Discovered suicide victim,"On Friday after getting home from work I heard a loud bang and after a minute dark smoke towering over forest. I hopped in my car and drove down toward it because I was sure that some stupid kids were up to shenanigans and wanted to make sure no forest fire was starting there. 
Instead I found a car up in blaze. I watched it burn for a minute or two, took few pictures and drove off, trying to find reception to call fire services to come and put it out. 
Only to realize hours later there was a half burned corpse. Someone commited suicide with three gas cilinders in his car, laid down in his seat and lit a match (information I've heard from people talking and the employer of the said person who was called on the scene during a police investigation)

The explosion blew the doors off and pieces of the car were scattered in 70m radius. I was looking at his corpse laying there with his scull dangling, hand halfway out of the door. 

When i opened my car window I didnt smell anything. Not even burnt plastic, not even the nutorious smell of burning human flesh. Just nothing at all. 

Brain does wonders to protects us i guess. 
It took me a few hours to understand what I was. 
I'm a complete mess. 

Im just glad that it wasn't kids who discovered it."

192,depression,Husband's depression feels like the end of us. Looking for some insight please,"My husband's depression has taken a toll on our marriage and I feel like I am in mourning. I have started seeing a therapist and he has medical help, but there is one particular thing that I want to get some advice/insight on from this subreddit.

In our three years of marriage, depression and anxiety has robbed us of most of our happy moments and barely allowed us to have a marriage. It's just been survival through a worsening depression. It has now become pretty bad where he barely gets out of bed unless it is to go to work. He is on medication and has a medical support system around him.

There is one thing I am struggling with the most. He can function, not well, but function when it comes to work, his family, friends etc. But when it comes to us, he can't seem to cope at all. He has barely been able to talk to me for 2 months now. Barely has his eyes open long enough to see me. I have reached a breaking point. I have found myself pleading with him to just say a few words to me, sit with me for a few minutes, just..... something. But he just keeps saying sorry.

I know he loves me. I know this is hard for him but it hurts to watch him be able to function with everyone else but not me. Please, has anyone else experienced this? I just want to understand and know if someone else has struggled more with their partner than in other relationships."
193,depression,Depressed and a potential drunkard (maybe?),"During my therapy when I was around 16, I was warned to not have any vices in the future if my depression would not go away.

After ten years, I gradually began drinking to feel physically, emotionally, and mentally heavier and eventually drowned myself to sleep.

I just started drinking last year when I could not afford to go to therapy and get the medications.

I hide this from everyone because I'm embarrassed that they'll judge me. Because those people who know me well know that I totally do not drink because of my beliefs.

I know this is my choice, but it's the easiest way to be numb and forgetful about everything for a moment until I fall asleep, so that I cannot overthink it until dawn.


And I'm honestly afraid."

They have confirmed I‚Äôm a disappointment and should be more like others, like my sisters. If I let them know my feelings about something they will treat it like an argument and get stroppy, patronising and embarrass me by making the whole thing public to anyone else. 

IM. GOING. INSANE!

I feel helpless, constantly angry, hurting myself. Whenever I go out I know they are talking about me behind my back. Going for a walk is me ‚Äòsneaking off somewhere suspicious‚Äô and I‚Äôve got to be back early, take my phone with me, let me know where ur going, etc. Im 21 (F) living in the safest town ever. Why the fuck do I need to be treated like this?! I feel controlled and shamed constantly. I feel like the lowest I‚Äôve ever been. I have no friends to confide in so all these feelings build up to the point I feel crazy."

I‚Äôve been taking medication for 4 years now. I‚Äôm just super confused and idk how to explain it. Like right now i have no energy and just feel like dying, idk if it‚Äôs because im getting older and i have more responsibilities like with my job, or if it‚Äôs something mental health wise. I‚Äôm just depressed i guess? I wanna go back to how i was last week where i was happy and more relaxed."
197,depression,SNRI saved my whole life but caused a problem,"Suffering depression for 10 years, finally I started the cure on May. I'm now taking snri, and it helped me a lot. Like I wrote on the title, it saved my whole life. I now don't think much about suicide and death, less negative feelings and thoughts. It also saved me from ibs (maybe not ibs I don't know actual disease name) which was killing me every day for 24 years of my entire life.

So, I'm very satisfied with my pill now, and don't want to quit it.

But after taking this pill, I have a problem on erection. I feel horny every day just like I did before. But every time I try to solve it, mine doesn't get up well, and easily lay down.

Does anyone have problems like me? How do you solve it?"

Talking shit behind my back or bringing up lies to my Superiors, so I would have an even worse Time there, then I have already.  In professional school during my apprenticeship, I¬¥ve received a lot of Insults  for being overweight and ugly ect.

My so called ""friends"" abandoned me after they¬¥ve recon  that I'm unable to go to big events anymore, because who could have thought, the depressed and miserable dude couldn¬¥t go to Party's anymore ? After I told them everything about my current Situation, they didn¬¥t even care.

My parents are ignorant C\*nts about that Subject ever since. Just coming up with the typical Statements like : ""there¬¥re People, who suffer more then you"" or ""Man up already"".  They genuinely don¬¥t care about my Situation. Probably never cared at all. 

I¬¥am so done with people . I¬¥am currently not working because I¬¥m mentally  uncapable of doing so,  what isolates me even more.  I¬¥ve become angry and nervous being around other People these days. The is just this desperate urge to flee from it all."

212,depression,Is it normal to have a blank mind?,"My mind feels blank. Someone is there, but it has nothing to say. It sounds dramatic, but it's what happens when I talk to people. Or try to do anything by myself. Maybe I'm just asking too much of me. For example: I used to love reading. I still do but I used to more. I can vividly remember books, what I felt, what I saw, why the author wrote this thing that way. I can grasp why an author did a certain thing this way, but if I practice it in a vacuum, nothing is retains. Or it feels that way. The same thing for visual art. I can see why an artist did a thing a certain way. I notice the small highlight there makes the whole thing whole. But if I sit down myself, nothing comes. The same with everything else. I don't know, I just feel like I'm in this weird inbetween of knowing the reality of things and then not being able to live in it myself. If that makes any sense. 

When I talk to people, they have this really interesting reality  where all this stuff happens, and things mean so much, and the world just seems interesting. But the same stuff could happen to me and I'd think nothing of it, or be unable to make a sotry out of it. Maybe I'm missing something, I'm not doing enough or haven't lived long enough, or don't pay enough attention to myself (even though I think about what I'm doing constantly), or what. I think about what the infamous Louie C.K said ""I'm just smart enough to know how dumb I am.""

What gives. Sometimes luck works out in my favor and I do something right. But most of the time whatever I do feels wrong."

214,depression,"Being lonely and depresses these few days, especially because of many movies delayed to 2023","I was usually a lurker here, but I really need to vent my stress and depression and I really need someone to talk to, I feel very depressed and lonely these few days and I felt that my mental health was getting worse in 2022, I only get to see my friends on weekends amd I cannot get to see them more often yet, which didn't really help matters because it led me to increasingly doubting and getting worried more and more about the state of my relationships, I became more lonely even until now, 
In these few weeks and days I browsed the internet and reddit and found out that Warmer Bros Discovery delayed many movies to 2023, Shazam: Fury of the Gods was delayed to March 2023 and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom was the worst offender;delayed to December 2023, but worst of many was Salem's Lot, a new adaptation of Stephen King's famous horror novel was taken and pulled off schedule, I wanted to see Gary Dauberman and the cast and crew's output in this film but because of this, it grew fears and doubts in me of the film's eventual state. I was still trying to move on from Batgirl's cancellation and many people like me lamented Batgirl's cancellation, the dire current state of Warner Bros Discovery and its leadership that caused all of these delays. The CEO gave a massive middle finger to everyone involved in the film, especially the directors and Leslie Grace, the cast and the crew.
On top of that I am still trying to find job and income, the inflation and recession made my family's economic state unstable and worrying, and we really need income, I need a job and a steady income to support myself and my family, and these few months were the worst for everyone, if only I can find a steady income I would be much relieved
I'm sorry for this lengthy post but I really need relief and someone to talk to to feel better about nowadays, hope you all have a nice day."
215,depression,75-80 hours alone 5 days a week every week.,"It's one of those nights where everything is wrong but nothing is actually wrong you just look at you're life and say wtf.
 
I did the math tonight and 5 days a week give or take a few hours I spend 80 hours alone. Monday through Friday. There are 120 hours in 5 days. 80 hours is more than half that alone. This is not by choice either. I have a rare auto immune disease that makes physical movement impossible sometimes. It sometimes makes normal functions impossible. Driving is a rare privilege. And I spend most of my time in extreme pain. 
So adding being alone on top of this self resentment and limitations. Life sucks. 
My husband doesnt even engage with me when he is home. He either sleeps or hes so enveloped with his phone that he can't even recall the last two words i said to him. So even when he's home I'm alone (not added into the pervious math) 

Looking on the outside things are great. I have a roof over my head, a husband, lots of fur babies... but seriously I'm so sick and fucking tired of the pain and being alone. I'm looking through my phone who can I call and cry to.. no one.
so here I am reddit. My first post. My expectation is more silence, more people who don't actually care and leave me alone in the pit of darkness to."

I hate it.
I do no know anyone where I live very well and we've rarely talked. It feels uncomfortable to open up to them. I'm kinda just barely okay. I'm alone. And I can't really talk to anyone because none of them have known me for more than a few conversations. 
And I'm trying to be friends with my ex, and somedays it's okay, but I can't help but worry all the time that he's just being formal. Like he doesn't actually want me around.

A friend with whom I was fairly close pre-pandemic but drifted away from, they decided my Facebook was too negative and defriended me. 

One friend suddenly blocked me on fb and phone. This person was chosen family. As in we literally celebrate Christmas together and shit. He said something about Facebook (I think he was referencing me being mad at the friend from earlier) and said he needed to ‚Äúwork on himself.‚Äù  But you don‚Äôt just ghost someone you‚Äôre that close with. 

And finally Greg is an asshole. My car got stolen and he literally told me it was my fault. Fuck Greg. 

I basically have one close friend/support left. So as not to fuck things up, I probably need to get a bit of space in there."
234,depression,Is this depression?,I think relationships with other people are too stressful. There have been events to make me think this way. Like why do I keep trying? I don‚Äôt have any family. My mom is dead and my dad is a huge a hole. I joined the military and made great friends now we never talk. Had girlfriends but all of them cheated. It‚Äôs just what‚Äôs the point? Being sad and alone seems to be better than being happy in the moment of something fake. I don‚Äôt think two people can have an honest intention of caring for each other
235,depression,Peptides - looks very promising!,"I recently stumbled upon the subject of peptides and I am rather exited about it! There are many peptides, each with a different set of benefits: inducing sleep, restoring energy &amp; vitality, stimulating neurogenesis and/or plasticity, etc. Peptides seem to be rather safe.

Not only do I want to share this with you for your benefit (hopefully) and perhaps collectively do some research, but I also want to ask if anyone has tried peptides and if you could share your experience.

236,depression,Scary thought ..,"I work with the elderly, there are those who have families who care about there well being and than there are those who literally have no one, just a social worker. 
I‚Äôm currently single, no kids (I doubt I‚Äôll have one) , a only child. I have living family members but we don‚Äôt keep in contact. I have a few friends but nobody calls me..
It‚Äôs so scary to think that I might be me, just alone forever. I hope and pray  this isn‚Äôt my future."
237,depression,Avoided admitting that I might suffer from depression because I feel like a burden.,"Just realized that yesterday. Anyone else? I think my SO is a very warm &amp; supportive person, and yet, I still would never tell him that I might suffer from depression because I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôd leave me (just my stupid brain feeding me bs). I bet many of you have always been there for others, but never really wanted to be a burden yourselves. 

It‚Äôs all spiraled out of control and I turned to booze (loads of it), without really knowing why I drink that much all of a sudden.

(Seeing a GP on the 1st to ask about meds. Terrified but also hopeful, that‚Äôs my last chance before I commit a slow suicide through booze)."

239,depression,I was at the swimming pool with my family yesterday,I felt very insecure about my body the whole day. It ruined the day. Today I cried about that. I wish I had a better body.
240,depression,I'm not sure why,"So I've been detached from life for a very long time. I thought I was good since I would anyway have my dissociation and disinterest to just carry me through and get the basics done like a job, maybe an average relationship, and just enough energy to go through the motions. Hell, maybe even occasionally enjoy some things too. But recently, something that would not seem very big in the grand scheme of things happened, and I've completely spiralled into feeling panicky, lost, feeling restless while doing anything, finding even the basic tasks overwhelming. I'm not sure if I'm even articulating this right, but these feelings are standing on top of an underlying feeling of complete and total tiredness. Its like they've have sprung up from the numbness and I feel both together. I don't know if this is normal..! Does anyone else feel this way? Or has anyone else who was numb suddenly started feeling very panicky, lost and restless?"
241,depression,Wallowing,I‚Äôm sinking into the pain and I‚Äôm letting my brain tell me I‚Äôve ruined my life. I‚Äôll never be happy. I‚Äôm not sure why but I‚Äôm ok with that truth. Just going to sit in the pain. I want to cut. What do I do?
242,depression,Nothing to Look Forward to,"I grew up abused (NPD parents), not close with any siblings, immigrated to a different country to be away from my stressors. Have spent years (and will probably a lifetime) working on myself just to feel normal.

Things were good for a while (Okay job, I have my gf of 15 yrs). But I am childfree, recently tried to get a dog and failed miserably, realized I don‚Äôt have the mental energy. These lately I‚Äôve been feeling aimless and stuck, like I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm here and it‚Äôs a struggle everyday just to feel normal.

Gf also feels more like a roommate than a romantic partner. She refuses to see therapist to work on our problems. My relationship was the only thing that worked in my life. Now it‚Äôs no longer the case and I just feel there is nothing to look forward to. Sure, I can travel, get a hobby, but in the back of my mind I always ask ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äô

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm that suicidal but I often think if there is a way to end my life easily and without pain, it would not be the most tragic thing. I know people who know me might feel shocked or miss me for a while, but then life goes on."
243,depression,where is my mind?,[removed]
244,depression,I think I‚Äôm finally done. I hate myself and everything I do. I just ruin everyone‚Äôs life eventually with self-sabotaging things I don‚Äôt feel like I have control over.,"I‚Äôve felt depressed for as long as I can remember. I‚Äôve lost contact with my family due to my parents abusing me throughout childhood. My grandmother (who really was more of a parent than either of mine were) died a few months ago and my parents prevented me from seeing her when she was dying. I‚Äôve lost contact with a lot of my friends because I am barely surviving day-to-day. Not just mentally but financially I am just gone. I can‚Äôt even call it living paycheck to paycheck because i have to ration when I eat towards the the end of the month. 

My partner just left me, for good reason and I just feel this is another in a long line of repetitive failure. I just fundamentally don‚Äôt think I can cope without them. Im obviously not telling them this because I feel it‚Äôs selfish to. 

I just can‚Äôt live like this anymore. Nothing is going to undo the trauma I struggle with constantly. It‚Äôs hard to trust anyone has my best interests at heart even when they definitely do. I have ruined every single relationship i‚Äôve had at this point and I‚Äôm done waiting to be struck by lightning."
245,depression,got out of depression + anxiety and here's how,"I started to notice how every time I was sad, anxious, or angry, it was because I was using too much of my head. In other words, I was overthinking too much, like right now. Then, I stopped thinking and could see, hear, feel, smell, and taste again. It was like thinking blocks your entire view of what's going around.

I went outside, and put my attention to how everything sounded. Even the cars, dogs barking, and the wind blowing all sounded equally peaceful. This all helped me stop thinking sexually, be happy consistently, and be way more productive.

A mindset I started to apply was not allowing myself to be sad ever again. When I feel slightly sad, straight up just said to myself 'no, I won't let myself be sad ever again.'

There are people who just want to be sad such as myself before. For those, do what makes you happy more often. If you have no clue, look around and try as much things as you can. I hope I could help"
246,depression,why do I feel this,"I can't shake this feeling of being lonely, but I have people to love and care about. It could be my family is spread out across America. I don't think that's it though. I went back to watch a show I used to watch with my brother and cried the whole time. Ugh, I just want things to be like the past again when me and my brothers hang out."
247,depression,I'm losing it,"Everyday is like a nightmare to me until nighttime hits, then my anxiety skyrockets and my depression takes a nap. it's always a dual fight between the two and I feel so exhausted about living more days to come. I have high ambitions but I feel so worthless that I feel like I shouldn't even bother achieving them. I feel irritated by everyone and everything, I fucking hate talking to people at this point.
everything is starting to make me gag, people being optimistic, marriage, shitty self care, fucking careers. it makes my stomach churn. Why do people do it
I don't want to live another 50 pathetic years before I rot in my grave, I want out while the wound is fresh.
I don't know. lately I just feel sick, metaphorically and physically. I can't stand life and whatever the fuck it's about.
These mundane tasks give me fucking cancer.
I don't want to fucking cook and eat and shit and take a shower and run shitty errands.
I have no control over my emotions anymore, one minute I'm crying my eyes out, the next I have a little hope then all goes downhill again until I start being a nervous wreck and weirdly give a fuck about lame human society stuff. 
I zone out to such an extent that I cant hold a two minute conversation 
I don't even want to type anymore"

252,depression,Hi could you help me,"this I am not sure where to go with this but I‚Äôve been struggling for a really long time, I uh don‚Äôt know how to word it all but basically I don‚Äôt know what to do? Like in a general sense of living


As a kid my dad was pretty abusive and I ended up with anger issues that I got therapy for as a kid, anyways he got increasingly more abusive until I started standing up for myself and fighting him back ( physically and by threatening to call the police) and my mom I thought really loved me as a kid but as I grew older she became more and more verbally abusive , one that really stuck by me was when she told me she could never love me because I couldn‚Äôt behave like a normal kid ( I think I have adhd ) I couldn‚Äôt tell u because I never got tested for anything since my parents ‚Äúdon‚Äôt  believe in that‚Äôs stuff‚Äù. (Also for a really long time I had a hatred for my skin colour since I got made fun of it in like grade 1 by a white kid) but I‚Äôm over that (it took a long time though). anyways here are the problems that arose from that. 
am extremely toxic to the people around me, I drag them down and hurt them but I don‚Äôt mean to, I don‚Äôt know why I do it it just happens. and the thing so do become increasing more and more unforgivable and cruel and mean and disgusting (I would explain in further detail but you‚Äôd also hate me like I hate myself )  I rarely try to get girlfriends because when I do I am manipulative and dismissive, when I have crushes I become creepy and obsessive. I put my friends down and hurt them and break their trust, i also never reach out to any one  (unless I want something from them) but I‚Äôve worked on this in particular  a bit since everyone has complained about it, (I feel even though I‚Äôm a bit sensitive I am very open to criticism). i want to know how to become a better friend/lover if you could help ?

Secondly I have rejected every open opportunity because I feel I am not worthy of them (also for some reason every time I openly talk about these opportunities them magically and randomly always fall through?) (like they just disappear completely?) and for some reason I can‚Äôt keep a job because I always fall through with commitment and also just being a general  dumbass (I would tell you my stories but they‚Äôre extremely specific and if anyone I knew read them they would instantly know it‚Äôs me (like on the level of reading a ‚ÄúFlorida man‚Ä¶.‚Äù You know it‚Äôs bad and very weirdly stupid and specific. Like these are very costly mistakes or very stupid mistakes that no ordinary person with half a brain would make, and I am very ashamed of them so I don‚Äôt actively go out and look for a job anymore (I‚Äôm a neet) 


Thirdly, I said I was good at school as I was but I never tried to go into university or anything similar because I don‚Äôt really want an actual job ( I don‚Äôt want to work till I‚Äôm old) also there was never really Anything that particularly interested me depending on my mental state I could say I equally enjoy/hate everything and anything. and if it died I would probably need to upgrade since I basically stopped showing up my last year of school and dropped 2 of my sciences because I became extremely depressed  (even though the were my easiest subjects) and got  60s in la and social (I did no assignments at all the entire year) (I still got 90s in math and calc because there was a rule that your assignments would be filled by your test mark.  I don‚Äôt hate school I just hate the idea of working in general so I didn‚Äôt go to uni or any thing like that (I would be open to the idea but I don‚Äôt really know where to start or how to look for something I‚Äôd enjoy ) 

The main problem I have is that for some reason  everytime I try at something it fails and explodes in my face, that harder I try the more it ends up backfiring,  then I give up  and 3 months later after a lot of pep talk I try and and the cycle repeats itself and I go back to into a depressive episode, I can‚Äôt seem to make any progress in my life no matter how hard I try and I don‚Äôt know why, it also feels like everyone is looking down on me now cuz they  see I haven‚Äôt accomplished anything and I always get asked ‚Äúwhat are you song with your life?‚Äù

For reference I am 20  have no job no car I don‚Äôt go to school I am not particularly good a anything I have no hobbies I mostly just spend my time jerking off in my room (I do go to the gym but I don‚Äôt particularly see the big thing about getting muscles or anything I just do it because I heard it suppose to help even though it really hasn‚Äôt done anything for me (expect make me look bigger I guess) like I said before even though I‚Äôm not particularly  attractive or anything I‚Äôm pretty short too I have never really struggled getting attention from girls but I don‚Äôt seem to be able to work up past initial attraction anymore ( I‚Äôve been holed up So long I forgot how to have normal conversation  or flirt or make comebacks or anything like that, I think I am still funny because people seem to laugh when I talk but maybe it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre laughing at me idk :(. I should probably mention my friend are kind of all growing more apart  from me (distancing  themselves) I don‚Äôt blame them because I‚Äôm kind of a loser that just annoys and hurts them.

Anyways bro or broette thank you for listening to my rant but my question is how do I fix myself? I have all these relay internalized problems that I don‚Äôt really know how to fix? i don‚Äôt really doubt myself but I conditionally judge myself for just living? I can only hope that it‚Äôs gonna work out for me but I don‚Äôt really know where to start anything? Also I want to say that I know my childhood trauma doesn‚Äôt excuse anything i do or have done but I just don‚Äôt know how to be better (everyone has baggage but it shouldn‚Äôt affect the people around you) I just need help on improving? and I‚Äôve made mistakes that are unforgivable but how do I move on from them? And how do fix a relationship I‚Äôve broke with a friend after I did something unforgivable but they still forgave me? Also i am not trying to hyperbol anything or blow anything out of proportion everything I wrote is what I think is to scale/realistic."
253,depression,"I just can't study math alone, almost every time i do so i just think about suicide","I feel extra dumb for this, it's embarrassing i couldn't fix it for years, because of that i failed school several times, like when i do programming and computer science in a way my neurons are fine, but some reason i already struggle with my mental health since i have a bunch of issues with getting more than 2 people interact with me at the same time and a bunch of other things i just don't get, i just can't get an hold on myself, it doesn't make any sense

It's kinda depression but it goes from entire months in from days yes and no and just straight up nothing, very random, i just can study a few subjects i have passion for 

Maybe I'm just stupid, no idea"
254,depression,I just feel like I can‚Äôt breathe anymore,"Idk what to say‚Ä¶ everything‚Äôs going so fast and I can‚Äôt keep up. The mental stress itself is eating me alive much less the obstacles ahead. Some people believe in me but I think I polluted their views on me. Right now as I‚Äôm writing this I feel as though I keep getting these weird waves of not being in touch with reality? Idk how to put it. It‚Äôs like a haze. Also it just feels like I‚Äôm being left in the dust. Idk if I want to get better cause it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve known for so long, as bad as that sounds. But I‚Äôm so tired. I genuinely can‚Äôt take it anymore. A friend of a person ik committed suicide due to the same reason I‚Äôm currently stressing right now. I see it now, well Ig ive understood it from before but I actually FEEL how bad it is. I‚Äôve also realised that no matter how much I speak about it, no one can ever remove this tumour. Im practically being poisoned slowly. I sort of called it though. Whether it was me being psychic or it was a self fulfilling prophecy, it just might lead me to my life being ruined before it even started.  It‚Äôs this weird concoction of fear desperation and a lot of hopelessness all mixed into one. I don‚Äôt think I would recognise myself if the me of 2 years ago saw the me of today. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I don‚Äôt know what to do. It‚Äôs raining right now. I like the rain. But I know it will come back to me. And it will cripple me and render me immobile once again. I want to be like *them* but it feels sort of impossible. They will never understand. I just want to be free. Not tethered to some self constructed void that draws away any remaining life force that I might still call mine. But what even is mine anymore. Who *am* I anymore. Everyone looks for happy endings, but I think that‚Äôs too unrealistic and jubilant. Maybe life doesn‚Äôt always have happy endings. Maybe we should just learn that, and maybe then we will be a bit more free."
255,depression,How does depression affect your relationships?,"Depression affects everyone differently. I‚Äôve struggled with trauma-related depression off and on for nearly half my life. For me, with regards to relationships, it can impact my ability to get close to people because of trust issues and low self-esteem. It doesn‚Äôt impact my ability to fall in love and continue to experience deep feelings of love. So when I start feeling the urge to isolate myself, I pretty much exclusively withdraw from friends and turn to my partner and family for support.

My last partner was different. He also suffers from depression and it‚Äôs prevented him from figuring out what he wants to do in life and then doing it. And it seems like because of that, he has trouble feeling strong feelings of love, to the point that he constantly questions his feelings in relationships and only realizes after it‚Äôs over that he loved that person. When he‚Äôs really struggling, he wants to run away. On the other hand, he has no trouble connecting with more ‚Äúsuperficial‚Äù relationships (acquaintances, not-close friendships).

I would like to know, how does depression impact your relationships with people?"
256,depression,what is this fuckery,"why does depression actually just suck ass. when u get out of an episode you feel like you might be actually acquired the skills to know how to not fall into another one again but no. this shit just happen a over and over and over and over again. I'm sick of getting my hopes up and finally feeling like I could live, when another episode happens and you are literally back at square fucking one. I'm tired."
257,depression,Helping an introverted friend with depression/ASD,"A friend of mine, who has been diagnosed with depression and ASD, rarely leaves their house (they are at an online school), except to spend time with me and my friends. They have some good online friends they spend time with online, but never IRL.

When my depression was more severe, spending time with friends IRL not only alleviated my depression in that moment, but for some time after. They might be an introvert, but I can't imagine that never seeing anyone face-to-face except for your parents (who they don't have the best relationship with) is healthy or beneficial to anyone's mental health, even if you have autism, right?

Now to the immediate problem: Every time something is slightly different/uncomfortable about the (weekly) meeting with my friend group, they say they don't want to come anymore. Examples include: someone else (from the friend group) has to pick them up, someone they don't know as well joins, we have to play a different game because too many people are missing, their depression is worse than usual, and so on.

Most of the time I can convince them to come anyways, and most of the time they seem to be completely fine. They say this is because they are masking their discomfort, and they say that they are exhausted after the social interaction, and that might be true. 
Now my question (and I hope especially that some introverted, depressed people with ASD can chime in): Do you think that it's still a net-positive to meet your IRL friends? How much of their initial unwillingness to come is cloudy judgement because of depression/social anxiety? Is it actually better for them to sit in their house all day, covers shut with depressed thoughts?

I really want to help them, but I don't know if I'm doing it right."
258,depression,I feel like I don't belong in human society,"I don't know what else to say about it or I have too much to say. Basically I don't know how to have close friend and have never been in a relationship. I don't like the way they work but still feel inadequate for being the only one not participating. In short I just feel so fucking lonely and am afraid I'll never experience love or intimacy or anything like it, and it all seems to come so easily to everyone else. Anyway I'm feeling low today and it's nice to vent here instead of bothering the few people willing to talk to me."
259,depression,Is there such thing as weather depression not just seasonal depression?,"Can anybody relate to having depressive episodes directly related to the weather on a particular day? 

I‚Äôm aware of seasonal depression but my understanding is this is caused by a period/season of darker colder weather which repeats each year in a cycle. 

For me (36/m/UK) a single dark and wet day can send me into a big depression whereby I feel zero enthusiasm or hope about life. I‚Äôm just floating in a trance through the day and cannot even imagine there being another sunny day in the future. Straight away I‚Äôm thinking I need to live in a warmer climate and fixate on planning where I‚Äôm going to move to. 

This week has been a prime example in the East of England. We‚Äôve had gorgeous weather and I‚Äôve been on top of the world. Bouncing out of bed each day, exercising, eating well, etc. then yesterday was a very dark, cold day and I just felt awful. However today is bright and sunny again and I‚Äôm perfectly fine and cannot understand how I was that awful person yesterday. 

Can anyone relate? Is this a known disorder? 

I‚Äôm a smart guy, I‚Äôm well read about depression and I‚Äôve had a tonne of therapy over the years so I understand the theory behind how our surroundings effect our mood and techniques to lessen the impact, but this is something that seems so overpowering. Nearly everywhere in the world has winters, and those places that don‚Äôt will have awfully hot summers. There is no perfect place to live, but that awareness doesn‚Äôt seem to help. 

TLDR: Can seasonal depression actually present in a more short term form of daily weather depression?"
260,depression,My brain is a broken mess,"I‚Äôm breaking people. I can‚Äôt stop posting about my issues. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how great one year or so was better and I was happy. 

I have ADD, health anxiety that patting  myself down with every jolt of the head in fear of a concussion (my brain is too broken for me to chance breaking it even more). 

I also have Depression.

I just can‚Äôt take waking up into a world of boring rejection. My hobbies reject me, my friends somewhat reject, my mind rejects me.
If I was to kill myself, my family and, if they exist, god would reject me.

I try to reject me my reality on a daily basis but it‚Äôs just so hard when your brain is so unbelievably unmendable that you can barely read your own name or the description to a show you‚Äôre interested in. 

Idk"
261,depression,My life,"I go to work at 7:40am and push carts for 7 hours in the summer weather. No time to socialize just carts. I go home tired. I don‚Äôt have anyone right now. I really want relationships and human connection and I got the balls to try to reconnect with an old friend but I could tell by their lack of questions and dry responses that they‚Äôre not interested. I feel I dont have value as a person. That‚Äôs why nobody wants to be around me. I have passions but im too tired, too much of a loser to get up and do them which just makes me more depressed. Ive been in therapy for 9 months and I doesn‚Äôt help at all. Every day just makes me more frustrated and mad. It looks so easy for everyone else."

I‚Äôm afraid of letting everyone down, even though I know I did nothing that was criminal or worth losing my job over.  However, unfortunately we live in a society where people want to shoot first before they hear your side of things. It‚Äôs a long story that I don‚Äôt really want to get into again.  My family and friends know I‚Äôm depressed and want to be supportive, but I don‚Äôt really think they know how bad it is.  I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist and PA that prescribes me meds but I cannot say it‚Äôs been helping. When I choose to stop existing, I would like to get it done as quickly and as painlessly as possible. In the end, we‚Äôre just meaningless and replaceable and I‚Äôve become discouraged from wanting to continue, because I can‚Äôt trust anyone anymore.  It‚Äôs going to feel embarrassing to return if/when hopefully everything works out because who knows what students and staff have been saying about me throughout this time reassigned.  If people knew how to communicate an issue to begin with and not go behind someone‚Äôs back and put their livelihood on the line, life would be so much easier, but people have to panic and treat everything as if it‚Äôs some federal incident.  Now I‚Äôm stuck in limbo in a corrupt and slow bureaucratic system that is indifferent to the well-being of its schools and teachers.  I feel that if I resign it will make me look guilty.

270,depression,possible reunion with childhood bff,"Today I met her mom by chance, dad and I were eating at a stall and suddenly a woman came to our table. She introduced herself and I can barely recognize her, it has been at least 15 years since I last saw her. I'm friend with her oldest child while my younger sister is friend with her younger child. My sister is still in contact with her friend while I lost all contact. The reason being we don't have phones back then. We went to different secondary school and life just goes on I guess.

So now we're both in the late twenties and haven't been in contact since primary school. She has had a great life from what I hear. She went to elite secondary school, studied oversea, have a great job probably. The siblings are all successful people. My sister is successful too.

I don't feel like contacting her because how can I explain how my life turned out. I'm depressed and unemployed. I used to be a bright kid but my performance declined because of depression I guess. Many things happened to me, I was bullied, humiliated, etc so I became depressed. Her mom asked for my number so she could give me her daughter's number. I saved her number but I don't know what to do with it. So now her mom has my number and if I don't contact her, she'll probably give my number. Her mom said she'll be happy if I contacted her because she has no friends if she's back in town. She lives like 12 hours away from our hometown.

271,depression,Depressed but restless and agitated?,"I've had severe depression for 4 years (20F) and go through very low spells where I feel v suicidal and down and fairly low in energy but push through. Prior to or following these periods I get very restless and agitated for days/weeks. I can manage on only a few hours of sleep and feel ok, I feel very restless and shaky like I have lots of energy and need to just go for a long run or do a workout or something to burn the energy otherwise I get so restless I need to self-harm instead because it feels like sm built up negative emotion. Sort of like a fight-flight response all the time with no trigger. Or like i've had loads of caffeine constantly. It's hard to direct it into something positive because underlying this is negative thoughts. 
This makes it a dangerous cocktail of having strong urges and the energy to act on dangerous thoughts. 
This does pass after a week or so though and i go back to normal/a bit slower to my usual depressed state. 
This is when I need much more sleep and feel slow and lethargic but still carry on as usual. 
Does anyone else have these periods of high energy anxious-like feeling?"
272,depression,I‚Äôm just so tired,"I‚Äôm so tired, I can‚Äôt deal with reality. I don‚Äôt want to be present, so I‚Äôm constantly spaced out. I‚Äôll do anything to escape. Drugs are my release. I know I‚Äôm hurting myself I just can‚Äôt stop, I don‚Äôt want to face the real world. I want to rot in bed, but I can‚Äôt. I study and I work. Then with 10 hours to spare at the end of my day, I smoke myself to sleep. I‚Äôm just so tired. All I seem to do is fantasise of death."

274,depression,What‚Äôs the point of life,"I just don‚Äôt wanna suffer anymore. No matter how hard I try, it just never gets better.

In real life, I never complain and stay positive around people. They disrespect me and complain about small fucking details yet have better life than mine. What the fuck is wrong with me for real?

I got toxic parents, but am living abroad and trying my best working 21 hours a week to make ends meet while studying at the same time. But it‚Äôs just not enough. My friends are buying what they want and have a desk to study and work at home. 

I CAN‚ÄôT EVEN AFFORD A GOD DAMN DESK!!!!

I‚Äôve been fucking broke for 3 years and I can‚Äôt take this BS anymore. Life is easy if your parents are rich, period.

I hate when people who got rich parents tell me ‚ÄúMoney isn‚Äôt everything bro so you should be grateful.‚Äù

I know it‚Äôs not, but it‚Äôs necessary!!

Tbh, I just hate my life at this point because I don‚Äôt compare myself to other people but I can‚Äôt help it. I wish I had a comfortable chair and a desk to work and study.

I wish I could eat healthy food every day. Insurance got me fucked up, too. I‚Äôm just losing my hope.

What the fuck am I supposed to do even  my parents don‚Äôt love me

Fuck everything"
275,depression,Tinder is just starting to feel like a scam tbh,"I have been using it for almost a year now and barely get any likes, despite the fact Tinder says I have 17 people who have liked my profile but I can't see them of course unless I buy Tinder Gold. So now I have been liking literally every profile now to find who liked me because obviously I should come across one of those accounts sooner or later right? Wrong.

The amount of times I liked as many profiles as I can only to get to the 'We can't find anyone else near you' screen is jarring at this point. Either I haven't actually had 17 people like my profile and tinder is lying or I'm just simply not allowed to see who liked me unless I spend money on Gold.

Either way, it feels like a complete scam. And It depresses the shit out of me, someone who can't go out to meet new people often at all."
276,depression,I feel like an impostor,"I started meds and seeing my psychiatrist every two weeks (tentative). I have been feeling numb for the past couple of days and just blaming myself for things. Maybe I‚Äôm just lazy, I‚Äôm not really sick or people have much bigger problems (although the other half of me of course is rational enough to know this isn‚Äôt true). It is draining and makes me wanna end it so I don‚Äôt have to deal with the constant loathing. If anyone else is dealing with this, how do you cope?"

I always give into those thoughts and choose just to not do anything because I feel like I don't deserve to be happy or do any of the things I enjoy.

282,depression,Nothing is ever enough for me,"I always feel insecure and unloved.  I have everything, but it‚Äôs never enough.

I wanted friends.  So I got friends, but I still wasn‚Äôt happy.  No amount of good experiences can get me out of my head.  I take more than I give, and I always feel awkward and disconnected even though I‚Äôm close with several people.

I wanted fancy degrees.  So I got those, but I‚Äôm still an undisciplined idiot who has no skills.  Just a few pieces of paper and the weight of Ivy League expectations.

I wanted sex and love.  I had my first kiss at 24, found a woman who loved me.  I loved her too, and it wasn‚Äôt enough.  I left her because  she slept with other men earlyish (4 months) into the relationship.  She said ‚Äúwe never discussed exclusivity‚Äù, and I tried o make it work for the next year, but I couldn‚Äôt get over it.  Now nobody else compares‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been over a year since we split and I still miss her sometimes.  I don‚Äôt trust her though, and I hate sex now bc of the trauma (among other reasons). Oh, and my dick isn‚Äôt shaped properly and doctors are useless‚Ä¶ so there‚Äôs that too.

So I saw a therapist.  Wait, actually half a dozen over the years.  The only one that stuck for a while gave up on me.  She ran out of ideas.  I can‚Äôt say I blame her, even though it hurt.

So I needed money.  My parents always paid for everything I wanted‚Ä¶ but it was never enough.  I grew up wealthy and can‚Äôt be happy with less. 

So I tried to be successful and focus on my career.  But I‚Äôm spoiled and I can‚Äôt help but hate every job because I feel like they don‚Äôt care about me.  I wish I had a mentor who valued me for more than I could provide in the short-term.

So I worked on myself.  I‚Äôve been in great shape, dressed well‚Ä¶etc, but it doesn‚Äôt make me happy for long.  I can never sleep and the nightly battle drives me insane.  I saw a doctor for this and it isn‚Äôt working.


Now, my hair is falling out and I‚Äôm gaining weight.  I‚Äôm convinced that I‚Äôm broken.  I don‚Äôt want to die, but I don‚Äôt see how I can live when I‚Äôm never happy.  I‚Äôve tried everything, and it‚Äôs never enough.  Now I don‚Äôt want anything.  I‚Äôm thinking of giving up.  I‚Äôve already been an emotional burden on people for so long, and I don‚Äôt know what else to do."
283,depression,Is virtual psychiatry/therapy effective?,"There's no place that I can physically go to in a reasonable amount of time that has a decent rating and is allegedly low cost. The good ones that do have those 2 qualities are too far but most offer telehealth appointments.

I don't think they'd work for me because I have a relatively short attention span. I also don't want to go to a badly rated one, or one that doesn't even have a rating because I've read way too many news articles about patients getting molested.

Do these actually work for people?"
284,depression,feeling fatigued,"I feel so fatigued. I have a skin infection, a boil. Its a chronic thing. Going outside makes me feel worse, especially if I have to be surrounded by people.

286,depression,I just realized that I am so lucky than the others maybe you are too.,"When I'm walking down the streets, I see some homeless people and street vendors trying to make a living, I used the internet to catch up some news i see some people who lost everything, and I just realized that my life is 10x better life than other and that I am so lucky because I got a place to stay and sleep every day, never run out of food, I have a job, and pay my bills on time.

And yet I'm not still quite understand why I am not happy, it's like something is holding me back to make my life even better, I couldn't remember the last time that I am so genuinely happy that it lasted for a few days, even months without thinking about my past or the future just existing in the present. 

These days I'm just faking my happiness, deep inside my heart, I am so hopeless that not existing is all in my mind.

why is that? is this a curse?"
287,depression,Broken up with a week after finding out I‚Äôm pregnant,"24f. Last week, I discovered I am pregnant. Which I know so many people dream about and pray for and covet. And I wish that were the case for me so badly. I wish I could be a mom. My partner realized that he couldn‚Äôt handle it, on top of his many other stressors in his life, so he broke ties. I‚Äôm trying very hard not to be upset with him but I am having the worst dysphoria I‚Äôve had to experience in my life. I was living in his apartment because I haven‚Äôt felt particularly good about the people who live in mine. Half of my life is in a car right now that I‚Äôll need to give up bc I am borrowing the car from my partner. I am uprooted in so many ways. 

I‚Äôve had a bad spell of depression &amp; anxiety in the past month related to work &amp; unknowingly being pregnant so in many ways I let myself go and felt secure enough in my relationship to lean on him a bit. But I feel completely shattered. It came as a shock to me because this was the person who showed me what pure joy was for the first time. I respect his decision, but I am hurting so ferociously.

I feel myself sinking deeper and deeper and I don‚Äôt know if I am going to be able to pull myself out this time."
288,depression,i want the free hug,"my uni is having a mental health event where they said we can get free hugs from a mascot and i really want to go for that. it has been years since i've had a friend and gotten a hug. i feel very lonely and felt comforted that a classmate sat next to me once this week. she didn't talk to me or anything, but it felt nice to be near another person like that when i've gotten used to sitting by myself in classes. i feel like i've isolated myself to the point where i feel like my existence is both invisible and repugnant, that people don't want to be near me. 

unfortunately the event is on the only day i'm not on campus (i have classes 4 days of the week) and i really wanna take the day off for a break. but idk i think i'll end up going just to get a hug from a giant bear. i'm an introvert but that would recharge me more than being alone and stuffing my face with food."
289,depression,Sabotaging my career,"So I have a pretty good job and get paid well for it. But, the stress of the job has slowly but surely contributed to a build of anxiety and depression over the last couple of years, to the point where I just want to quit. Like most people, I'm two paychecks away from bankruptcy, so quitting really isn't an option. I feel trapped in a cycle, that I can't find a way out.

I've gone through counselling and meds, but it just seems to be a band aid. Of course, I've looked at changing jobs, but I'm just making myself more anxious and depressed thinking about it, I can't even gather the motivation to start a search and go through the whole dance.

Does anyone have any advice on how to break the cycle of depressive thoughts about work, to the point where a career can be salvaged and even to the point where I love my job, again?

Thanks!"
290,depression,how do I become happier?,"I've done things that should make me happy, i lost weight, finished a school year without summer school, and I feel somewhat more comfortable in my skin, but nothing I do helps, i hate myself and want to die, i feel like I'm unlovable and have a face only a mother could love, and fear a relationship but I've been told I'm nice, have a good personality, and that's it, I got called handsome by a drunk lady, but nothing after that no one saying "" hey my friend likes you"" or anything like that, people talk to me like I'm mentally retarded or something, my dog doesn't even make me happy and I cry everytime I see her because she's itching and I don't know what to do. I've tried socializing but I always feel off or awkwardly look away and quickly snap back. I feel like my friends use me so they can hotbox a room and have a place to stay but if they have a reason to drop me they would.

Most of those who are open minded and have the resources leave to other countries and all that‚Äôs left are mainly the ones who still believe in good ol‚Äô folklore. I‚Äôm not saying everything is bad because at least I eat food and I‚Äôm not hungry although I do worry about going hungry because I‚Äôm unemployed. My grandma is the only one I really have and she currently is battling cancer. The rest of my family are just incredibly toxic and uncultured. My parents abandoned me since birth after my own mother poisoned me but I survived though I almost died, ever since I had a huge weight problem due to it and a shitty immune system. I applied to thousands of jobs since I graduated in 2020 in France. I couldn‚Äôt work in France because France chose to no longer give Visas to North Africans, which is very depressing to even think of, to think of how we‚Äôre just the secluded losers no one wants. I have a masters degree and I speak three languages fluently plus some Italian but it doesn‚Äôt matter. Jobs in my country won‚Äôt ever hire you because the corruption rate is incredibly high and nepotism is the main way to get a job and I don‚Äôt have access to that kind of albeit unethical ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù. Other companies around the world won‚Äôt even hire someone with no visa because most don‚Äôt wanna bother with visa sponsorship. A company hired me (big 4) in Belfast then bailed when the visa sponsorship took more than two weeks. After that I sat in my room crying everyday, broke and sad as hell. I don‚Äôt wanna let the dark thoughts win but it‚Äôs hard when everything is hard and I have no open doors."

I don‚Äôt have the energy for it. I‚Äôm scared getting a job will push me over the edge. I‚Äôve had jobs before and the beginning is always so hard. I end up enjoying my job but it takes a while and the first few months are hell. I can barely take care of myself. I want to fucking die. All my clothes are now on the floor. I don‚Äôt eat. I‚Äôm barely hungry. Looking at food makes me nauseous. I want to get better but I don‚Äôt know how. I‚Äôll try to ask my dad about therapy. I‚Äôm just so tired.

295,depression,Depression when everything is fine,"I'm not sure how the post will come across, as I know there is people in this sub that are truly struggling with real problems. So, as the title says, how do you handle depression when everything around you seems to be okay? 

Everything in my life seems okay, I have a family that cares, good friends, a girlfriend, a job that I like (for the most part), financial stability, hobbies, a house. However, I feel pretty miserable. I been breakdowns every couple of days where something will just trigger me and I start crying and I can't stop the emotions. I'm also struggling to do chores so I been out of  clean dishes, and food, for over a week (I been managing to pick up food at least once per day). 

It's not that I take anything for granted either. I come from an immigrant family and we struggled a lot when moved here. I understand how lucky I am to have everything I have, but it just doesn't seem to matter. Sometimes I look at other people and they seem to be able to be happy/satisfied regardless of their circumstances. I don't feel like I need my life to improve in anyway, but I'm still miserable. Anyone have a similar experience?"
296,depression,"Please, I want something good to happen to me",I need something. I want something to make me feel good. When was the last time I was happy? I'm either doing 'bad' or 'tolerable.'

Everyone I used to be friends with have drifted away (expected but still painful). I live with and love someone who is rarely emotionally available (he was raised that way and I have a hard time accepting it). I want so desperately to talk to someone for hours and hours about life and mental health with someone who gets it for once. I feel so alone. I can‚Äôt afford therapy. Can‚Äôt vent to the people I love. Idk what to do. I want to sink in a hole and disappear forever. I keep asking myself whether or not I‚Äôm in the middle of another depressive episode and I have no fucking clue. My (ex) best friend used to know how to ground me and bring me back from this hell. I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm angry. I‚Äôm desperate. I‚Äôm alone.

299,depression,I need to get this out here,"My past few days have been some of the hardest of my life. There are moments of happiness and pure bliss but i constantly feel as if I am drowning. Not in pain or suffering, but the feeling of pure emptiness and nothingness. Being with friends, drinking, video games, nothing has been helping and i have to plaster on a fake smile and pretend that I am fine. There have been moments where I have considered suicide but the knowledge of the pain and suffering I would put my family and friends through has made me reconsider. I have started self harm again to help stop the emptiness but it seems to work for only a few moments before I lose all feeling again.

Part of me doesn‚Äôt want things the ease up because it‚Äôs like I won‚Äôt get this chance again. 

I‚Äôm at my absolute lowest of lows, I‚Äôm 26, I haven‚Äôt had a girlfriend in a very long time, my friendships are all fading and it‚Äôs not even like I could utilize friendships well anyway. My brain is absolutely fucked, I‚Äôm an introvert with, ADHD, depression and anxiety so my thoughts are a constant jumble of misdirected garbage, can‚Äôt even look people in the fucking eye. I feel like this is it for me, I have no hobbies and all I can‚Äôt do to cope is fucking smoke weed on my days off.

When I‚Äôm working I‚Äôm your average asshole who makes one and two day deliveries possible if you catch what I‚Äôm saying, everyone I know has surpassed me in every way and management picks on me and gives me the worse jobs on the site. Why don‚Äôt I switch jobs you ask? I can‚Äôt, that would require a license that I don‚Äôt have and the reason I don‚Äôt have that is because I‚Äôm so mentally unstable that I lock up during driving and nearly cause accidents. 

Am I a person with no hope? If you don‚Äôt think so then what then? I can‚Äôt even get psychiatric care because I can‚Äôt afford it, my family has always been poor and this job gives me what is basically pennies for what state I live in.

I‚Äôm so fucked, I‚Äôm stuck and I see no way out. I‚Äôm embarrassed to even exist and I feel embarrassed now even typing this. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm a concoction of failure, like I was made to suffer. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm even alive, I can‚Äôt even fathom dying or existing like this any further. The pain is unreal and I can‚Äôt even cry. I‚Äôm absolutely fucked."

A few things to get out of the way, this is a long distance relationship that is quite far.

We‚Äôre both minors with myself being 17 and him being 16.

With that out of the way, today has been a difficult evening as he confessed he‚Äôs harmed himself and is having trouble with his urges. This conversation continued with him explaining that he‚Äôs suicidal and doesn‚Äôt want my support and basically telling me he‚Äôs a burden and I should get rid of him. To the best of my abilities and in the heat of the moment I tried to tell him my stance and my experience with people in my life killing themselves and ultimately he explained how keeping people who‚Äôre mentally unwell alive is only making them more miserable, and he doesn‚Äôt blame me for holding onto hope.

It‚Äôs been 2 hours since things died down and he presumably went to bed. But honestly I‚Äôm not sure what to do but keep fighting as I know deep down inside if anything happens to him. I‚Äôll never be the same.

TLDR, I‚Äôm just looking for advice and some perspectives."

I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a bad thing to think but I think it.

I lie a lot about my happiness and I make this image of ‚Äúhaving it all figured out‚Äù to the point where a lot of my friends come to me for advice some even look up to me and have told me that. 

Im in school to
Be a dentist I want a degree in biomedical sciences or microbiology.
I just had to leave a loving relationship of 3 years to chase my dream but I know there where a lot of things wrong with that relationship I knew she lied to me about a lot of things but she also loved me so much she didn‚Äôt want to hurt my feelings she wanted me to feel special. I knew about these lies for a long time and I would just push it away but then it got close to us having to leave to move to New York for school and in her culture to go anywhere outside of her house with a man you must be married.

Mind you we are 22/23 we don‚Äôt have a lot of money saved up we are both college students and we are about to move to the most expensive city in the US. People around us are saying just move get married later and I agree with that and she does too but to and extent her family wants a grand wedding and they aren‚Äôt helping us at all so we have to figure all that out or don‚Äôt leave our small little town and another year goes by and we get set back in school and life. 

fast forward 4 months I get into my program in New York and I have to leave in a week, I tell her and her family this I say we have to go you already go into yours I just got into mine we have 6,000 saved and we have a place to stay we can do this. She‚Äôs iffy and I understand it‚Äôs a big move but the way our relationship was it was so strong this was a no brainer. We hav remade so many sacrifices for each other in every way! 

I ask her is there anything you need to tell me on why you don‚Äôt want to go ? 
She says she‚Äôs been lying to me about a lot of things and she‚Äôs afraid it will be revealed when we move and she will
Be stuck if I leave her. I tell her we can work on these things I know you‚Äôve been lying I‚Äôve prepared for this moment. We go back and fourth and realize it‚Äôs over 3 years of every day together hard times and good times VERY hard times and it‚Äôs over. I pack my stuff and leave. 

I drive 22 hours to New York and I‚Äôm putting on that fake persona again I have brothers and sisters but they are much older and Caribbean they don‚Äôt really understand. 

I‚Äôve been taught to not show emotion never let anyone see you weak , my dad sided a few months ago and I want to cry but I haven‚Äôt shed a tear I haven‚Äôt even cried about this as  bad as I want to. 

All this bottled up turns to anger I get so mad so quickly. I know I made the right choice but I‚Äôm so sad and down and I‚Äôm tired of being fake I want people to know 

I‚Äôm a mess bad things do happen to me and all this is a front I‚Äôm messed up. 

My problem is I do have a lot of knowledge and I give very sound advice so no one knows I‚Äôm down bad."

306,depression,missing my friends and feeling kinda down,"i‚Äôm on holiday with my family and i know it makes me sound ungrateful but i wish i could be at home with my friends. my family are strange and it‚Äôs difficult to describe how testing it is to be around them, especially nonstop for two weeks. it also means they‚Äôre constantly watching what i do and eat. there‚Äôs no privacy here. my family are constantly fighting and screaming, and when i open my phone i see all the parties i‚Äôm missing at home. i‚Äôm not doing much here except from sitting around in the heat a lot of the time and eating at overpriced restaurants. i don‚Äôt want to seem like a brat but the lack of routine and socialising is making me slip back into a bad mindset and i‚Äôm finding myself thinking terrible things because i‚Äôm miserable, stressed and pretty bored. i‚Äôm worried that things will go downhill again since i only recently started to feel better. i‚Äôm also anxious since no school means no structure or certainty, but i‚Äôm nervous about going back to school as it means facing the problems i left behind when we broke up for summer, as well as preparing for exams. hopefully things will be okay again when i go home."
307,depression,depressed,"i just feel bad, raw, vulnerable, and sad. i don‚Äôt know why apart from depression, there‚Äôs no way for me to cure this feeling. i am just trying to self care my way through it (food, shows, rest) but i feel so exhausted. i am so tired of feeling this way. all i want to do is sleep all the time. i feel so so bad):"
308,depression,Can I just die alrdy,Not suicidal but honestly sick of this shit
309,depression,just feel overwhelming alone,"today i have officially lost all my friends. my supposed ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù of seven, going on eight years has ditched me for a girl she‚Äôs known for maybe 6 months and moved in with recently. 
my other ‚Äúfriend‚Äù pretty much used me as an emotional support crutch till he got a girlfriend. he traumatized me last week, calling me, screaming into the phone saying he was alone and had a g*n to his head saying he was gonna do it and i was all he had. this put a lot of weight on me as i felt personally responsible for his well-being. 
he did this a day after my little sister and brother accidentally od‚Äôd, and my little sister was in the hospital for 3 days for serious issues following what happened, then got sent to a mental health institution for a week. i blamed myself for everything, as i should‚Äôve seen the signs, etc. 
my boyfriend has been supportive to the best of his ability, but he has his moments. we live with his family, and they don‚Äôt bother to even talk to me or even ask about my siblings, or me for that matter. i really don‚Äôt care as i have no respect for them to begin with, but no one‚Äôs even asked me if i was ok this entire time, other than my boyfriend. 
i have mental health issues myself, and all of this has thrown me into a major depressive state which is dangerous as i‚Äôm bipolar 1. 
just needed to get this all out, because i feel broken and used. 
thank you."
310,depression,I wish I could feel something or have something to look forward to.,"I'm so miserable, guys. Holy fuck. Zero social life, zero ambitions, zero motivation."
311,depression,Someone just kill me,Not suicidal just tired of this shit someone put ne out of my misery
312,depression,im fucking ready to end it all,"i genuinly cant do this shit anymore, its not even just depression i think im spiraling into insanity, i have the scariest thoughts, questioning reality, questioning god, questioning why i suffer so much, are we in a simulation? am i put here to strictly suffer and obsess over all these thoughts, if gods real why wont he help me? i cant fucking suffer anymore bro im just a kid and im drowning my brain with my own thoughts, im scared if i talk to anyone ill end up in a mental asylum, and that will just make me worse most likely, i cant imagine myself being genuinely happy, every night every day 24/7 its just fucking suffering and slowly descending into madness, i feel like im gonna overload my brain and just snap at one point, please, i want it to get better"
313,depression,i've been isolated for so long. everything seems so meaning less :(,[removed]
314,depression,How can I smell less terrible?,"A bit of an embarrassing one. But I need help. I have had severe issues with depression for 2 years or so. I have become less strict in my formerly multi-faceted bathing routine (I loved showering before this), and often skip days at a time because I just can‚Äôt motivate. It has caused issues with my relationship, the value I put on myself, my confidence to go out. I always seem to smell sweaty in like a stressed way (not a nice after work out sweat, if that makes sense). I forget to put on antiperspirant or deodorant most days/nights. In my feminine area I never feel I smell right, and I am so self conscious of it. My bladder leaks occasionally a little bit post surgery I had 2 years ago, so I always feel horrified that I will smell like urine too. I developed a UTI from not bathing enough after sex, most likely, and I feel so ashamed and smelled even worse and felt even dirtier the whole time. 

How can I set up a new routine I can stick with to feel less wretched? Any advice for motivating myself to get in the shower? I want to be normal again. Sorry if this is completely gross, but I‚Äôm really sad and low about this. Thanks for any advice. 

FYI I have very long hair I try to wash every other day but when I neglect showers entirely it goes a little longer sometimes. I love soap and dislike body wash. My skin condition is fairly normal, not too dry."
315,depression,I shouldn't be alive,"My mother had a medical condition that her doctors said she'd never have children. I wish they were right. 

I don't want to deal with this bullshit life. Everyday tasks, and just existing is exhausting. I can't sleep regularly, ony a few hours a night. Some nights not at all. 

I think about dying (not necessarily suicide, but those thoughts happen too) nearly every waking hour. I just want to die. I don't want to exist. I shouldn't exist. 

By most people's standards, I have a fairly cushy life. I don't need a regular job (at the moment), and I spend most days rotting my brain on YouTube and playing minecraft for hours. But I also have to watch my parents get older and deteriorate. I need to do tasks that they're no longer capable of. I want to leave, but I can't abandon them. They need me. I want to die or I want them to die. I want all our suffering to end. None of us deserve this life."
316,depression,I don't want to do anything,"Nothing is motivating to me. I (27 genderfluid, mostly male) don't want to work towards goals. I don't want to do my hobbies. I don't ever want to get a job. I don't want to cook anything more elaborate than frozen pizza. I don't want to read comic books, or watch TV, or scroll through social media, or do literally anything. I don't even want to walk.

I felt this way earlier in the day, so I took a nap. And then I woke up and still felt this way.

I think I know what it is. I just hate the problem AND the solution:

Virtually everything I've ever done for my entire life, from my education to my food choices, has been doing what everyone else wants me to do instead of what I want to do. And now I'm just realizing how little I care about all the things I've done my entire life, and now I don't want to do anything.

If I can shift to what I care about, maybe I would actually want to do anything. But even that feels like that's just something everyone else wants me to do, instead of something I want to do. I don't want to become more authentic &amp; prioritize my core values. Everyone else just keeps telling me I should. And it requires a LOT of emotional labor, and I'm too exhausted to do that."
317,depression,not sure how much longer I can go on,"There's a whirlwind of emotions I've been going through these past couple of months. From severe anxiety to severe depression. No one would notice if I went missing and the only way they'd find out is because my job would probably contact someone to ask about why I'm not showing up. I live alone, no one reaches out and seemingly no one cares. My whole life has been full of one way relationships, it's always me who has to reach out even as a kid. I've taken the hint that I'm just not that great of a person as much as I try to be. Anxiety and depression has been kicking my ass lately and I'm pretty close to letting them win. I have no one and feel like no one. I have no confidence or hope for the future. Most days I feel like I'm doing everything for nothing. I honestly don't know what to do."

320,depression,Empty,"As of lately I just don‚Äôt understand anything anymore. I get so frustrated and depressed. I‚Äôve gone out with friends and as soon as I get back home it‚Äôs back to nothing. I‚Äôve gone to therapy and it helped some but not much. I‚Äôve tried medication but I had terrible side effects and honestly I‚Äôm afraid if I had access to medication I‚Äôd over use or attempted something. I was diagnosed with HSV1 when I was 17 and I‚Äôm now 31 and I still feel horrible. I‚Äôve never gotten over the stigma or my life back. So much has happened in my life and I hate victimizing myself but some days it just feels like it‚Äôs never going to end. I just want to feel safe. I lose track of time,sleep, hygiene, and I can‚Äôt seem to remember things correctly any more. I feel like my life is thing big secret to everyone I love and I‚Äôm struggling alone and idk how to open up but I‚Äôm so tired of the internal screams and cycling thoughts."
321,depression,I wish I had the luxury to be sad,Whenever I am sad people get pissed and tell me to kill myself. Reality hurts.
322,depression,My life feels pointless,"Ever since i was in my teens i struggled with depression, severe social anxiety, and very socially awkward. All i wanted to be a normal guy with a decent talent that have a girlfriend or wife. I have absolutely no fucking talent at anything. I have been rejected, laughed at, taking advantage of for being nice and called names by girls i had a crush on in high school.

&amp;#x200B;

I was bullied and it still haunts me this day at 23 years old not standing up for myself so i didn't get expelled. I wish i didn't give a fuck about those rules and just said fuck those rules and cave the fucking bullies skull in. I regret not going to college, i regret being the dumbass that i am not getting my drivers lisense when i had the chance.

&amp;#x200B;

I regret not being braver to approach the girls i liked and not having the social skills to actually have a girl i liked to actually want me, and maybe i wouldn't be a 23 year old kissless, dateless virgin. I feel pornography plays a role in why i was so fucked up mentally in my teens ( i am trying to overcome porn and am on a streak of a week so far), but you know what FUCK porn! It ruined my life and robbed me of a good childhood. I curse the day my dumbass as a kid first laid eyes on it, and only if i knew the long term effects it would have. FUCK PORN!!

&amp;#x200B;

It is hard for me to get a job due to having no job experience and making the major mistake of taking a couple of gap years off but then this damn virus showed up out of nowhere and fucked everything up as soon as i was about to get a job.

&amp;#x200B;

2 years later, for 3 months straight i have been trying to get a job, and due to no transportation the job must be on a schedule that aligns with my parents job so i can get picked up but so far at every step of the way i have failed at actually aquiring a job. Everything is so damn hard for me and i fail at everything. I wouldn't wish my worst enemy to experience the soul crushing failures, and embarassments i have in my life. I know posting this won't change a damn thing, but fuck it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a worthless sack of shit, with no purpose in life, and wish i was someone else instead of this loser i am now."
323,depression,This is it,"I‚Äôm almost 60, my mother has Alzheimer‚Äôs, and my wife takes most of the care of her. We‚Äôre not unemployed. No one wants to hire us.

My wife hasn‚Äôt taken great care of herself over the years. Until the last 10 years, I have.

This is my future: my wife will die, my mother will sink further into the Alzheimer‚Äôs abyss, and I‚Äôll have a one bedroom, rat infested apartment, alone, watching my mother sit in the corner drooling not knowing who I am.

When she finally goes, I‚Äôm blowing my head off.

No one will miss me.

I see this future every day."

I've always been the friend that gets excluded and is nobody's first choice, I don't think anybody even likes me anymore my parents are always pissy with me and my friends seem to get aggravated when I things they don't like (which is hanging with them I guess.) I've been on several medications and none of them have worked, so now I lie and say they're working fine and that I don't need to take them anymore. I've been self harming for about 2 years now and I have no intent on stopping anytime soon. I hate living, I hate breathing and I hate being on this fucking earth. I don't really intend on living too long. But I'm probably going to kill myself within the next year or so. I just don't care anymore."

 I'm a hight school student who is going into his Soft More year. I have no goals and life just seems pointless and this point in time. I get burn out from nearly everything I do. I feel nothing, for the past 3 years I have forgotten what it's like to feel happiness. Everything is a chore to me. The anxiety just pops up at any given time, ""im practically shaking as I write this"". I just keep on falling deeper into a hole of nothingness. My neck is sticking up from my grave. Everywhere I go I can't help but stare at the ground. I had plans in the past all failed because of the lack of motivation to do so. I don't want to talk anymore. When people talk to me I barely speak. All I have is my girlfriend. But I can't open up to here. I am useless. I'm so lazy I sit in the shower and say there for an hour at the least. It took me 45 minutes to write this. That's how slow I am. I am truly a selfish peace of shit. I DON'T WANT TO FUCKING LIVE ANYMORE."
332,depression,Shutting down,"These past few years I noticed how I have been shutting down and staying away from people. I've always had a hard time making and keeping friends but now I don't even bother to make an effort. In fact, I'm pretty sure I hate people now. I haven't been given many reasons to like most people even though I still try to be open minded but I don't bother telling people anything anymore or opening up. I know not everyone has to but I'm a very expressive person and for me, closing up is pretty much the death of me. I can't imagine continuing life like this, being alone and isolated all the time but not being able to stand other people. I don't know what else to do but hope I don't wake up the next day or that I won't have to live very long. I have gone to therapy but I don't like talking to therapists. Maybe I can try art therapy or some other form of expression."
333,depression,Wanted bad/negative things to happen deliberately,"Anyone with diagnosed depression thought of that? Well I cant share or explain any specific examples of negativity actually happening in our lives, it's illogical of thinking this way. I have done this quite a lot in my preteens and adolescence

I am an adult now but my mood disorder issue has re triggered due to an event

The closest example I can give you is wishing that those classmate who always are taunting come at me again, want to get rejected and have a life of misery where some random crush I had would be with someone else as I fail to become a good provider due to my sucky academics and working a shit job"

Im so self-condemning that I can't tell whether my progress anything worthy of any sort of admiration. I've had so much free time the past couple years that I can't help but get in my head. People say any progress is good but, I could have tried finishing my GED faster, could have applied to more jobs, I could've been more diligent, I could've...I DONT KNOW...no one hiring me even though I have the qualifications...why? Am I not good enough, am I to egotistical? I thought I provided a light atmosphere when talking to people, I have the experience, everyones hiring...

338,depression,A lot on my mind‚Ä¶,"I am gonna try and keep this as short as possible.

I Was Taken advantage of sexually at the ripe ole age of 7 by some family members. Then again By a grown man at 10 at a daycare. Then again by an nasty older woman (Maybe late 40‚Äôs) At 11 at a different daycare. My parents divorced when I was 8 months old- nothing good ever came out of it. Stepmom forced cheese down my throat when I didn‚Äôt want it until I puked then did it more-hate cheese now. My Biological Father made me eat his size portions throughout childhood leading to Weight problems (Some till this day). My mother was verbally abusive. I was bullied mercilessly from middle school until high school. As soon as my friends from elementary school found their place in (School Hierarchy) they all abandoned me. I am ugly and never had any long term relationships. Shared my story with girl with similar trauma. (She was raped by her own father twice). We had a very close relationship. She couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and killed herself right before high school. Always terrible luck with jobs. Circumstantial hell. Had 3 relationships since school ended. All of them cheated on me. Life is in shambles. I have purity issues now. Been talking to girl in interested in. She already has a kid. Don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm good enough to be someone‚Äôs second choice. Never been a first though either."
339,depression,so done with life,I'm turning 30 this year and I realize I haven't accomplish anything. I quit my job because I thought my tourist visa to New Zealand will be approved. I was denied. I'm currently looking for jobs but every job post is either social media marketing or virtual assistant with low pay and graveyard shift. If I go for a career shift it would take me months or years before I become good at it. I tried searching for scholarships abroad but there's an age limit. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of the interviews where I need to act jolly and excited to please people. Death isn't the worst thing that could happen to me right now to be honest.
340,depression,Everytime I think about her my day gets ruined and I just want to isolate from everyone.,"I had an ex of four years and everything was great in our first three years but then as we got into our fourth year upcoming on our fifth anniversary she became different. Once school started back in person she kind of changed, she got friends and hung around guys. Our relationship wasn‚Äôt the same anymore. She kept ‚Äúmaking mistakes‚Äù when it came to some guys and through screen sharing on FaceTime I found out she was telling other guys she misses them, putting hearts in their names, sending them hearts but then would tell me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I never meant to hurt you‚Äù but I‚Äôd told her multiple times to cut off the guys that obviously had feelings for her but she would always say ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard because I‚Äôm a social person I like to have friends‚Äù Truth be told I don‚Äôt know if she lost interest or was trying to keep me around as some emotional support while she did me wrong. After awhile between my friends talking sense into me and me coming to the realization she wasn‚Äôt going to change I finally ended things with her, she kept trying to talk to me wanting to be friends but I couldn‚Äôt do it. Everytime I look at her all I see is pain and regret. She finally got the message and we haven‚Äôt spoke since July 15. The last couple times we spoke she told me that she has breakdowns, doesn‚Äôt talk to anyone anymore, the guys she was messing around with don‚Äôt talk to her anymore because I‚Äôm guessing she isn‚Äôt fun to them anymore now that she‚Äôs depressed. To be honest I don‚Äôt feel sorry for her I don‚Äôt feel sorry for cheaters and should reap what they sow. I can‚Äôt go a day without thinking about her and all she‚Äôs done to me. I‚Äôm broken I‚Äôm not who I used to be, I don‚Äôt eat anymore, I stopped my hobbies, I don‚Äôt play video games anymore everything‚Äôs just boring to me now and all I do is go to work and if I‚Äôm not at work I just lay in my bed listening to music."
341,depression,This is kina my last hope,
342,depression,Everyday feels the same,"(24m) About 3 years ago I landed myself in the hospital because of my attempt. I was asleep for 2 days when I woke up I remember the faces of my family. I was with my then girlfriend at the time and when I got through the baker act it felt like I had to restart for everyone so that i don‚Äôt hurt them again with my stupid actions. This was the second time I was baker acted for an attempt. The first time I was in 10th grade. The first time I had a thought about ending it I was around 8yrs old and I woke my dad up from sleep with a butter knife in hand and told him I didn‚Äôt want to be here anymore. I have scars that I‚Äôve given myself years ago, recently I‚Äôve started to cover some up with tattoos, but the pain still is there. I‚Äôve hated myself for so long.


Well around August of last year it was the worst year for me, mentally it‚Äôs been exhausting. I broke up with my girlfriend, too much toxicity from the things she used to do and would do(mental and physical trauma). I thought I was the issue every time we fought, but she had a twitter where she would talk shit about me and talk about how she liked other guys. It hurt me a lot it killed my trust but it was my fault for finding it and betraying her privacy.. that‚Äôs what she told me. It hurts. That‚Äôs not fair. I finally hit the switch and broke it off after finding a better job that‚Äôs a 9-5, got out of customer service which I really needed.

During the time I broke up with her and started the new job I was messing with a  girl that got out of a similar situation. We had worked together at my old job, and always flirted but never did anything because knew it wasn‚Äôt good  for my relationship. Well when it ended we hit it off great. I mean she got out of a toxic relationship too, I knew it was going to be a rebound situation but we both needed it. She was amazing, I never knew how it felt to be treated by someone who actually cares about you. She showed me her scars and I showed her mine. Well she eventually told me that I caught feelings and she didn‚Äôt want that so she removed me from her life completely. Last time I saw her we kissed and I always look at the same spot in my driveway when I come home from work and the memories rush back. She left and never spoke to her again, last thing was a snap I sent saying ‚Äútake care of yourself if you ever need me I‚Äôm here‚Äù

It‚Äôs almost been a year and since that occurrence and I‚Äôve been to the hospital 3 times. The last time I was there I split open my knuckle from punching a mirror. I hate myself, id never hurt a soul but I hurt myself. I may not be able to use my hand the same, and it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt even care.. my family is torn I could go on so much about how. Everyday I think about that girl how she treated me how it felt. But I don‚Äôt want to feel the pain of someone who doesn‚Äôt really care? Like not saying she didn‚Äôt but heartbreak sucks. And I don‚Äôt want to be in a situation where I feel controlled like I have to please every part of who I‚Äôm with. And finally‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt want to be alone. I wake up go to work go home play games work out and go back to sleep to repeat. But i cry everyday I think about all this shit everyday. The games and the books are just minor distractions, they don‚Äôt even seem to work all the time. I hate crying and Im afraid of dying but what‚Äôs worse? A repeated loop? I mean everyday just feels the fucking same and I honestly hate it. Sure I can change it by adding another hobby? I mean I go out with friends but it feels like there‚Äôs just something not there, I hate this. I guess I‚Äôm just finally realizing how insignificant I am in the massive world filled with people making more by doing less or striving for a future filled with gold so they continue to pick up the scraps in hopes for a miracle.  

Right now I‚Äôve settled on the fact that I‚Äôll never see her again, never hold or speak to her. I‚Äôll continue to live my life waiting for an opportunity to make good money to just live without the stress of waking up for the same routined shitty 9-5. I know I won‚Äôt love again or have someone because I‚Äôm clearly not in a good place and I don‚Äôt want to feel that pain again. I‚Äôll die alone I know I will. I love my friends and family but I can‚Äôt burden them forever. They‚Äôve been so good to me and I know it‚Äôs selfish but I‚Äôve been so selfless maybe it‚Äôs time to be selfish. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the ramblings. It sounds crazy when I reread, it‚Äôs 2:38am and I have to wake up for work at 7:30. I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about how my life is a loop now, I know there‚Äôs gotta be ways to get out but right now I‚Äôm stuck. And I don‚Äôt know if I can continue. It‚Äôs been a hard life so far and this year just really blew up on me. I wish I could just leave this planet and look down to see how small everything really is compared to the spaces outside of our perspective. Falling in reverse. Thanks for reading."
343,depression,Depression for me.,"Hello, my name is James and I suffer from depression. I have a hard time even talking about depression with people sometimes because they just tell me ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs bullshit and it‚Äôs in your head‚Äù, nothing like that‚Äôs happened to me before.‚Äù Well that‚Äôs great for them. 

I could be having a great day, it could be Friday, we got paid, we don‚Äôt work tomorrow. 
All circumstances are good. Nothing to really complain about. Yet sometimes I‚Äôll just have this feeling and I know it‚Äôs coming. 

Could be having an excellent day and out of nowhere  I can feel this feeling coming over me. I can tell when this feeling is coming and I‚Äôll say to myself in my head, James, all is good, nothing is wrong, why are you feeling like this. Honestly I don‚Äôt know. I think to myself in my head as I‚Äôm starting to feel this and say ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going on? What got you here? Everything is going good right now what‚Äôs making me feel this. I think this as the feeling is coming on. 

I attempt to use logic thinking and figure out what has brought this on. I can‚Äôt. Nothing bad has happened am I‚Äôm thinking to myself what is making me feel this way out of nowhere. 
I don‚Äôt have a reason for myself. Talking to my friends about it they just think I‚Äôm crazy. Well from there point of view I‚Äôm just getting depressed out of nowhere and it prob sounds crazy to them. Well I‚Äôm not an unreasonable person and I can clearly see what I‚Äôm saying and how it just sounds silly to them. It sounds silly to me.  

If I can‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs happing myself how do you explain it to other people. I just sound ridiculous.  

I‚Äôve had some friends say oh well I got depressed when my grandmother died. 
I understand that and I get it. When I say I can get depressed out of nowhere for no reason they just say it‚Äôs just in your head man. 

I‚Äôm not saying they don‚Äôt feel depressed when a loved ones dies but when I say it can come out of nowhere for me out of the blue, they just look at me like I‚Äôm crazy. Me not being able to explain it myself, I get them saying I‚Äôm just nuts. Hard for them to understand it when they don‚Äôt experience it like that especially when I have a hard time understanding it myself.  

I just don‚Äôt know why this comes over me when things in my life appear to be good.  

Crazy enough I can literally feel it coming on, I know this sounds crazy and off the wall. So yeah I can see why this might be hard to believe for someone not experiencing it themselves. 

Anyone else out there experience it coming on out of nowhere?"
344,depression,I still get anxious from seeing a photo of my ex and I feel like I am an idiot,"My ex dumped me over 2 years ago. I have had a many of dating app matches and conversations, hook ups with guys and girls and others, and a couple of failed relationships. And no amount of hanging with friends, antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, smoking weed, or anything can get rid of that feeling I feel when I even see a photo of her. It sneaks up on me and when I am unfortunate enough to see something related to her, my day is ruined and I just can‚Äôt think about anything other than how pathetic I feel. Its been over 2 fucking years and I still can barely bring myself to say her name. I wish I could wipe my memory of her existing. But I know deep down, I really wish she just didn‚Äôt give up on us. Which sucks cause I thought I‚Äôd be over it by now."

348,depression,loneliness will kill me,"Little rant sorry
Hello, weird thing to say but I want my depression to get worse and consume me till I can't take it. I've had the push through anything mentality for years,. I know one must suffer to find peace and happiness but suffering is my entire life. There's no one in my life, I can die in bed and not a tear would be shed for me. The life of working to pay bills and then come home to nothing is retarded. Years spent trying to make just 1 friend and nothing. Loneliness will be my killer not me. Why suffer for nothing, I get if you have kids or something that makes you want to get better but I got nothing. 
The one thing to save me would be having just ONE friend but my efforts to make on have failed. Just having someone would be enough to make me stay."
349,depression,I think kms is the best thing I could do for me rn,"So, rationally speaking and leaving all emotions aside. I have no emotional reason to end my life, by which I mean that it's not something I thought about on a whim, but why continue? 

I am turning into a bitter, lonely human being and I know how my life will be, I've known for some time now and if you're me, it's really not that hard to predict. 

I was not crying when I started writing this but I am now, not at the thought of ending my life but at the thought of living it like this. I am more terrified of continuing this grey, useless life than of death."
350,depression,How do I bounce back?,"Back in September/October I went through one of the worst battles of depression in my life. I was very close to attempting suicide for a second time. I gained almost 40lbs and I completely lost who I once was. This lasted till April of this year. I feel im slowly climbing out of the hole. Im maturing. Im growing. I‚Äôve lost almost 30lbs and I kicked a bad pornography addiction. I am just over all making the climb out of the suicidal rut I was in. Yet there‚Äôs still a big chunk of me that‚Äôs missing. I recently got into a relationship with a wonderful woman but I just don‚Äôt have the confidence and‚Ä¶ability (for lack of a better word) like I did before. I find myself making far more mistakes, being more insecure, and being unable to preform as well as I used to in bed. Not only that but on an individual standpoint i just feel like im missing something of myself. Im sorry if this doesn‚Äôt make sense. Any advice or kind words would be appreciated as I am fearful I‚Äôll slip back into that really bad place."

But I‚Äôm just thinking about it. 


Why can‚Äôt I just be happy? Why am I so miserable?‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm just so trusting of people and keep getting fucked over. I‚Äôm an idiot who loves everyone and I need to stop‚Ä¶. Idk‚Ä¶.. I just think life here isn‚Äôt for people like me. 

I spent like an hour reading posts on the sanctioned suicid3 site‚Ä¶. But like I just don‚Äôt have the courage to end it. Maybe bc part of me is Optimistic shit will get better?‚Ä¶. But at the end of the day‚Ä¶ what is the point of all of this?‚Ä¶. We are all going to die alone anyways."
352,depression,Invisibly Empty,"I‚Äôve never posted to Reddit, I never post anywhere but at this point I don‚Äôt know where else to go. 32/m diagnosed with major depression since 16 and adhd since around 18. 

I did therapy in my teens and have finally made decision to give it another shot, but needed to put something in writing. 

I‚Äôve denied to myself and my loved ones how numb I‚Äôve become. I‚Äôve always been easily sucked into the dark side of my mind, I think it‚Äôs become a familiar comfort to fall into despair. I‚Äôm afraid most that the cycle of depression and anxiety has become inseparable from my self identity. I‚Äôm not sure if I know who I am without that part of myself.

The rest of the world sees me as a quiet guy who‚Äôs happily married to a phenomenal wife, two beautiful kids aged 1 &amp; 4, financially doing great, killing it at work, great parents, great friends‚Ä¶. Reading this sub I feel guilty even posting here knowing the blessings I have.

All I see in the mirror each day is a workaholic and neglectful husband, absentee dad, forgetful friend and family member, and overall selfish person. Somehow I also turn that self criticism into being a victim which does not help the negative way I view myself.

My daughter at 7 months old recently went through an aggressive brain infection that landed her in the hospital for a month. She could‚Äôve died, it was the most terrifying thing I‚Äôve ever experienced. I must‚Äôve made a hundred deals with god trying to trade my life for hers. She‚Äôs home and healthy which is literally a miracle I‚Äôll never understand. 

all of a sudden I went from sleeping nights at the hospital, drive home and  work 15 hours a day, breaking down every minute I was alone in fear, hiding that from my son and family, 7 days a week for a month. Then one day she comes home and the world goes back to normal.

I‚Äôve never felt so alone, helpless, desperate. Then, it was over and people talk about it when it comes up like it was a bad bout of flu. I was already at my breaking point mentally and emotionally but I will never forget the feeling of isolation while she was going through that.

I feel like all I want to do all the time is vent to someone, but feel no one actually cares. When someone does, I only feel guilty for burdening them and regret it after. Those I do lean on either have betrayed my confidence or seem uninterested. I work more hours than I thought possible to provide for my family, yet feel like I‚Äôm never enough for either.

All day every day I feel fake. I just don‚Äôt know how much longer I can pretend. I‚Äôve been through my fair share of shit in life, but also realize it‚Äôs nothing compared to most and I am grateful for what I have yet feel I don‚Äôt deserve it. Lately I just feel like I‚Äôve run out of people that actually care to hear about my life let alone ask how I‚Äôm doing.

I feel isolated, I‚Äôm doing the things I always had on the priority list for life, but with each achievement just feel more and more alone. I feel the last 15 years has been a slow spiral and no one really sees how close I am to falling off the edge at any given time. 

I should be happy but I‚Äôm not and don‚Äôt V even know what that means anymore. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep up the act, but also don‚Äôt have a choice but to deal with it. i feel like I‚Äôve been on the brink of a mental breakdown for over a decade, but my kids and wife gave me a reason to suffer through what previously were more dangerous thoughts. I can accept that and won‚Äôt give up like that even if only for them.

 I just wish i could remember the feeling when I was younger and thought those around me actually gave a shit about how I was doing. I get how that sounds, but can‚Äôt shake the feelings that I know it‚Äôs truth.

I used to be full of hope, optimism, idealism, passion‚Ä¶now I just feel empty. A machine only as good as it‚Äôs productivity who‚Äôs random cries for help are tolerated until it breaks once and for all and no longer is useful. 

I‚Äôm always tired. Always feel out of place. Always on a different wavelength. Always just a bit off. Always inadequate. Always feel separate, unsure, insecure. I‚Äôm just exhausted and feel out of places to turn. 

If you read this, thanks for listening to me ramble. This sub has helped me realize I‚Äôm maybe not as alone as I thought, hopefully my thoughts can do the same for someone else."
353,depression,Ever thought about killing yourself... no I mean,I have thought of this everyday of my life for the last 5 years I'm 21 now and  have literally seemed to have hit rock bottom I have been fighting it so long but the last two weeks it seems everything in me has drained out and I will be sitting in my car on my break from my shit job at 3am and I'll just start getting bombarded with all these thoughts of how I should do it and have lost that feeling when your thinking of taking your life that gravitates you away. I don't think this life is worth it anymore the pain the stress and the thoughts in my head will be the end of me. Just needed somewhere to say this.....

356,depression,any tips for not feeling so empty and negative even though i have a lot going for me?,"
i am 16 and im diagnosed with depression and anxiety. i have a ton of stuff going for me in that i have super supportive (although not always understanding) parents and a good therapist and mentor. i have a couple friendships but usually they never seem to last more than a couple months and if they do then it just makes me bored bc theres only so much you can talk about before it starts feeling forced. it makes me seem like a bad person but thats just how it is. ive been hospitalized 4? times and none of them really helped. i always go back to how i am feeling now. empty and suicidal. music soothes and comforts me but it cant help me overcome extremely negative thinking. school is coming up and idk if ill be able to handle it. i dont want any clich√© bs that ive heard before either. i want something that can actually help me feel a bit fulfilled. also u ask me anything if u need/want more info."
357,depression,I‚Äôm addicted to sexting and can‚Äôt stop,"Just typing this makes me feel like a manwhore. I spend a lot of time on the cumtributes and TributeMe subs, sending cock and cum tributes to women who ask for them. I really enjoy doing it but the problem is that I can‚Äôt stop at all. I wake up at 3AM to see if there is any woman online looking for a cumtribute. I‚Äôm a slut who needs to cum on women‚Äôs pictures and show it to them. I need validation that way. When I saw that they enter the chat but they don‚Äôt reply I worry about if they might find that my cock is too small or I don‚Äôt cum enough. I always have to ask them if they like it or not. How do I get a grip of myself?"

359,depression,I don‚Äôt know if I have depression and Idk how to seek help,"I‚Äôm 18F, and I think I have depression. I have never sought out professional help bc my family would shame me for it bc mental health is extremely stigmatized in my community. In high school I never planned on going to college bc I didn‚Äôt want to live past 18. Then by some miracle, I got accepted into this program at my state university. Seeing how proud my parents were, that gave me a reason to stay. Now I recently got a job related to this major and a sense of doubt is settling in. I feel like the initial joy/pride, whatever you want to call it, died after my first year of college and now all I can feel is anxiety, panic and dread for the future. So what if I got the job? So what if I will graduate? So what if I find success in my career? I don‚Äôt want to do anything. The only thing that truly gives me comfort is sleep and video games, if I‚Äôm being honest. And nowadays, sleep is the only thing I can do. I don‚Äôt want to work, to get married, to have children, to be an adult, to do anything. I don‚Äôt want to go out either. I used to love the idea of traveling the world, but now idec for that anymore. Now I just want to hide from the world. 

Before anyone comes for me, I hate that I‚Äôm this way. I want my doctor to give me meds, something, anything, to change and rewire my brain and make me happy. I have no money for therapy and I don‚Äôt want my parents to find out either. Sometimes I wish I could just go peacefully in my sleep but that‚Äôs too much to wish for I guess."
360,depression,sad,I think it‚Äôs better for them to not know everything. Like if my mood is down and they want to know *why* just to go back to whatever they‚Äôre doing I won‚Äôt give them any answer. I‚Äôm just going to keep a couple of things to myself. I don‚Äôt have anyone else so it‚Äôs best for me to come on here and vent. I‚Äôm just better off alone‚Ä¶
361,depression,I'm so selfish,"Currently in my life I have it all that sould make me happy. I have a fianc√©, a son, a house and a decent job. Unfortunately, I've left myself unmedicated for the longest time and as a guy i dont have much people I'd turn to. The two years of lockdown probably brought me to this as i worked long hours all from home with government restrictions on what businesses could open or not. On Friday I tried to take my own life after weeks of putting it off. 

I'm currently in an inpatient facility and I feel even worse now. What a selfish cunt I am for even thinking all of this and to even attebpy to go through with it. I'm not better, but on reflection I'd never want to hurt my family. Why am I like this? How did I let it get this far?

Anyway, I'm saying this here as I don't want to address the 'why' with my family yet on this topic. They know I'm here currently and even visit, but I'm so ashamed that they're so supportive to a piece of shit like me."
362,depression,hardest part,"I think the hardest part of my depression is after all these years , is when you can feel it creeping back in after you've been doing so well for months, and actually was feeling kinda happy. But now I feel myself falling back into the dark place and I hate it"

I‚Äôm not in the best shape but I‚Äôm not super fat. I just don‚Äôt have self confidence or hope for the future. I‚Äôm not as suicidal as I was but I still think about it. I just moved so I don‚Äôt have access to in person contact with my friends. All I‚Äôve done is drink and smoke to keep myself occupied so I don‚Äôt start having those thoughts. I just want a girlfriend or friend in general who actually cares about me and wants to hear about my day. I feel like I am the odd one out with my family. My brother doesn‚Äôt speak to me my sister is in collage and my mother switches from fine to angry in an instant. My father is a former army soldier who is now strung out and going to jail for a hit and run. Life is just hard. Nothing keeps me happy. I just need some guidance since I haven‚Äôt been able to talk to my therapist who is going through chemotherapy

365,depression,I have this feeling that I just wanna be dead.,"I read this quote by Murakami which said ‚ÄúEveryone, deep in their hearts, is waiting for the end of the world to come.‚Äù

I cannot see a better way to describe this feeling. I don't wanna kill myself really but I do feel like hurting myself sometimes. I've never done it but I think I've come pretty close at times. I just wanna disappear for a while I guess... or for eternity. Or maybe I don't wanna die but I just wanna be dead."
366,depression,Need help,"I was diagnosed with depression few years ago. I was on medication for a year until the doctor stopped it as he thought I didn't need it. When college started after pandemic, I started feeling anxious all the time so I consulted psychiatrists. When that didn't work I went to the psychologist I saw before. She told me to try few things. They worked and now I don't feel anxious. But I am not still happy. And it's all my fault. It seems like I don't want to be better. I talk to others, I go to doctors but I don't work on getting better. I don't know what to do. I see no future for myself. I'm not suicidal but for now living seems pointless. I want to want to get better but it's been this way for years."
367,depression,Wife says she is depressed because of me,"So in addition to having anxiety and depression so bad that every day I wish a meteor would land on me, and the fact that the one parent I have left is about to die, my wife admitted that at least part of the reason she is so depressed is because of me.  Apparently I am such a loser that it makes her unhappy.  It makes me want to tell her to go on ahead and GTFO then but we have two young kids.  I feel like she should go ahead and stand over on the side of all the other people who told me that I was nothing, and a loser.  I probably am not making much sense right now but I am in a very difficult place right now and this was a kick in the nuts.  I am pissed."
368,depression,I feel like I live for everyone else,"I've suffered from depression for my entire life, I'm on the autism spectrum and need help with the most basic of tasks. 
I constantly feel like I have to live for everyone else and get no fulfilment out of anything that interests me.

I've tried so many different medications, therapies, psychologists, changes in diet, exercise, the works but no matter what I feel like I am not going anywhere. 

I feel alone in the world even if I do have loving friends, I have a terrible fear of losing them, like I bother them just by being around them.
I forget everyone has a life and doesn't have time to talk 24/7 but it really feels like the world is ending when one of my peers lives their life when I struggle to do that myself.

I think about death mostly every day, I couldn't ever take my own life however if I was to die I wouldn't fight it.
I just don't like living and I don't like the responsibility of being an adult, I imagine nobody does but the world is so overwhelming and I'm scared of it.

Sorry if this is all inappropriate, I need to get it off my chest."

371,depression,been offered a Project Manager role for a new firm but,"I just can't bring myself to take it. The pay is very good with a company car but my anxiety, depression and brain fog is just stopping me from taking it. In my current state I know I wouldn't last more then 3 months.

I have zero PM skills and I come from a mechanical engineering background (working in aviation) which I hate and stuck with for 9 years until I started having panic attacks in the work toilets 2-3 times a day due to mistakes I kept making constantly. I left this job 6 months ago still unemployed but have had job acceptance for low end engineering roles but my mind has a breakdown everytime I land one and I never accept.

I feel like I hate engineering that much that I just can't stand working in the field as I know I'll creep into a darker place with my depression and anxiety.

I have had time to reflect on what I would like to do and that is IT but trying to land a entry level role with zero experience is non-existent.

Anybody that's switched careers into IT give a little help? I'm thinking I should find a temp job in anything to pay my mortgage whilst doing countless amounts of online courses and boot camps. I just want to do something I enjoy instead of being false around people that are nothing like me talking about their modded shitbox cars all-day.

I care about him but I just don't wanna look at him anymore after the amount of jealousy he has he got mad at me for being to close to my female friend bc we don't the whole fake gay thing just like guys (he does it with his friends too) 

Back in march I was SA'ed and all he did was break up with me and i couldn't even look at myself in the mirror I feel so gross and he said he'd take me back after 3 days of fighting he didn't even mention the guys name once it was all me 

Anytime i tried to leave he threatens suicide and drags fights out for up to 4 hrs over a simple outfit accusing me of wanting another man's attention he hates when I hang out with friends with out him 

Once when I didn't respond to him for 3 hours he blew up at Me and said I ruined his night when he ruined mine bc that night was the first time jn months I didn't see me mom over 9+ months with out a women I an very close to 

He tells me I'm a shit girlfriend and once went on a rant for 15 minutes on how great his ex was and all I could do was apologize everyone says I should leave even his best friend I don't even say I have a boyfriend most of the time anymore 

I'm falling in love with another person and I'm to scared to to leave...

I managed to get over the break up and what not but recently I found out that my ex has found someone new and this is something I‚Äôm experiencing for the first time. Having put all that time, money and effort in and giving all the care and love a man possibly could meant nothing because in the end I‚Äôve been replaced. I know that I shouldn‚Äôt let it get to me but I‚Äôve extremely  depressed and I had gotten through it once but idk if I can this time. I loved her dearly and idk I‚Äôm in so much pain in unbearable. The worst part of it all is that I‚Äôm the one that let her go because I not only was going through my own things but I knew it would be better for her in the long run.

This for me is a new experience I‚Äôm trying to deal with since I‚Äôve never been in this situation before but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm doing a good job if I‚Äôm being honest. It just hurts so much because I still care about her and love her but at the same time I have no right to since I was the one that let her go. I did it for a good reason and that was so that she could move on from me and meet someone better because I knew I wasn‚Äôt the one for her. But anyways now I‚Äôm here, extremely depressed and lonely with no one to talk about this with. Idk if anyone has any advice or anything but if I‚Äôm being honest I went through some pretty bad depression once and barely made it out so idk if I‚Äôm going to make it out this time."
379,depression,one hell after another,"I'm 21/m btw and I'm the kind of person who always tries to look strong no matter what hell they are in and will never ask for help and rarely vent to others. Not good at keeping personal diary or stuff so seeing some people venting here made me think maybe i can just type it all down and set it lose on strangers i never met nor will.
So this last year has been sort of one hell after another.  
Met a girl online. Fell head over heals for her and she said the same.It was all innocent love. Not even close to anything dirty or sexual since we only met and interacted over online and through texts.I'm mostly shy around girls since i never interacted with any throughout school and college so meeting someone online was ideal for me in that way. Someone naive as me who believed if you give someone all your love and care and never asked anything in return maybe things would result in an happy ever after got a rude awakening when the ""I love you too"" replies stopped coming. Even though she was the first to say it i guess i fell for it 'cause it was all new to me.
Welp she has stayed on my mind for like almost an year now with me questioning myself that why would someone even do this but i stay strong without cursing her and just accepting that i was the dumb one.
Moving on earlier this year my father passed away. I was there holding his hand when he passed. I didn't shed a single tear through out everything even though i wanted to just because i had to stay strong for my family. Now i feel like even my tears have gone dry. I don't tell anyone but it's a lot like a LOT. Well due to this i had to take a sort of break from studies so i can take over Dad's businesses. Watcing all my classmates and friends graduate,being social having girlfriends is a whole other existential crisis i get every day.Although i do plan on continuing my studies next year after i'v gotten a better grip on the bussines and have it more streamlined. 
I'm still trying my best but i'm also getting tired. I just keep strong for my families sake so that they have someone they can look too as being firm and strong and someone the can lean on.
Bunch of other stuff happened too like fam drama. Logoun ki asliyat sach mayn tub he nazar aati hay jub ghar mayn barra nahi rehta is a fact.
All in all it feels like i haven't slept in ages. My mind is in a constant state of being over clocked as in i have to be blasting music always to drown out my thoughts. 

Lonely but won't do anything about it. In pain but can't show it. Tired but can't stop. Hurt but can't heal.

WOW you actually made it this far.Thanks for reading i guess and sorry for this sucker punch of depressing stuff. The point of all this is not to look for sympathy or anything like that. Its just a way for me to vent to someone without actually venting to someone IYKWIM."
380,depression,An erasure of persona.,"Left a relationship that was deeply meaningful to me in many ways, despite the fact that it was, perhaps, equally destructive... and I find myself coming to grips with a new reality, a reality where I am much more fragmented than I previously was.

I'm not sure if there is any way to feel whole again; wholeness feels like a lie, a myth, something I keep perpetuating in my mind to only dissuade the slow, creeping sludge of negativity that seems to be swallowing me each passing day.

I think the worst part of this is how indifferent I feel to the transformation. I can't speculate on what a soul could be but if I have one, it must be disintegrating into the stark apathy of whatever this fresh hell has mired me into.

I'm tired of time being the bandage, the salve. Time isn't healing me. Time is just another circle of hell where I find more things to turn over and cut myself upon. Maybe one day I'll find some way to feel differently... but until then, I suppose, I'll endure each day like I did the last; barely."

385,depression,It's so hard to ask for help.,"I have battled with depression before and I have been through therapy and then I got better. 

That was 4 years ago. Now I am in a worse situation. I will always feel that I will never get rid of this illness however hard I try. Maybe therapy once again will help me but only for some time, eventually I will fall back into it in 4-5 years time. And it's so expensive in my country, I can't even afford it. All I need is someone to talk to and that is the main problem. 

My friends are the best people in my life and I love them more than anyone and they also love me. Last time, I think more than the professional help or anti-depressants, their support made me better. When I told them what I was going through, they called me regularly to check up on me, listened to my cries, rants, and my thoughts. I am grateful to them more than anyone. But at that time, we were in college so we had time for each other. 

Now we live in different cities, some even in different country. All of us have our own separate lives and all of us are busy. We talk with each other as much as we can, but that's like once in 2 months or so. I cannot tell them how bad I am once again. I don't want to put them in such a position. They are busy with their careers and I can't be one to ask them to take time out for me, because I cannot be so needy. I don't want them to listen to me when I know that they have problems of their own. They are living away from their families, alone in a strange city with not too many friends; I know everyone of them battles daily with a lot of issues. I cannot burden them with my own problems.

Everyday I am spiraling deeper and deeper in this hell. My sleep cycle is fucked, my appetite is ruined, I have lost interest in my hobbies, I don't ever feel like talking about myself to my family because living in denial is much easier than facing their concerns. 

It's so easy for me to fake normalcy when I know inside me is a void. People cannot see the what anyone is going through. I just wish I had someone to talk to."
386,depression,nothing is working,"absolutely everything seems overwhelming.

i feel unloved.

i fight this mental battle in my head 24/7.

i can't sleep.

everything in my life is not working.

i'm really not sure why i keep typing all of this crap out to random people.

i've been in this state nearly all of my life."
387,depression,What Needs to Change?,"For a long time I've thought that the solution I was looking for was a major life change. I've accomplished a goal that I set out to do but I still have this feeling of emptiness that has been here for as long as I can remember. I remember the first time that I realized what this was. I remember thinking that this isn't something someone who has the privileges that I do can experience. I denied it and took the course of convincing myself that it's not that bad. That there are people who have it worse. 

I constantly question what the point of any of this is. I've been covering up this thing that has been weighing me down. I've always felt like this is something I'm not allowed to talk about. Like this is something someone like me should be able to put up with. You still have parents, crazyparty. You have a great future, crazyparty. You can get through this just think positively, crazyparty. These are all things I've heard repeatedly.

The most recent way this shadow has effected me was when I was at work. I helped someone fill out a government form online. I knew that they needed a confirmation page. I suggested they save the confirmation page before they left, and they were flippant about it. I know that should have insisted upon it. I didn't care. I let them leave without it. I know this is out of character for me. This depression is what created the person that let them leave and then come back to do the online form all over again just for the confirmation document. It was more work for me and I knew what I had to do to get it right the first time, but on the surface I didn't care. I wanted to get back to my work computer to distract myself with the game I was playing so I can stop thinking.

I have difficulty socializing. I have trouble eating and sleeping. I'll go the entire day without eating. I've started eating 8 to 10 hours after I wake up most days the past few years. I constantly feel like the people around me wish I were gone. I don't feel comfortable reaching out to the people I normally would (I guess what I said earlier illustrates why). I want to get help. I need to get help. I've never been on medication for this but I think that it's time. I'm scared to see the doctor. In the past I've ended up in the hospital or in a psych ward due to this issue compounding with other mental illness. I don't understand how or why I've been this way for so long but I cannot take it anymore. Thanks for listening."

Is this normal or am I going insane"

390,depression,i only feel happy when i eat :(,it's basically the only thing that gives me pleasure any more. i eat and feel 'happy' for 5 minutes and then i go back to bed and just wait until i can eat again. it's pathetic. even spending time with people i love doesn't come close to how i feel having an ice cream or something. it's a viscous cycle because im depressed because i have body dysmorphia but i love food too much and then i hate my body even more and feel more depressed. i wish i was one of those people who loses their appetite when they're depressed but instead i want to eat everything in sight to fill the void. idk what to do i just feel so hopeless :(

I didn't developed any talents resulting to no passion. I don't have any talents nor passions to make out a living. I used to hate those grumpy adults having no life but I see myself turning into one. I feel numb and no motivation to start my days. like I have nothing to look forward to.

I was never loved, my family kinda abandoned me, I never had a friend, all my life I was alone. Depression made me lose interest in many small things which used to provide me small amounts of joy. I am almost 30 and I don't have anything/anyone to live for. I have lost hope that I will ever be happy again. I am just trying to figure out if the struggle is worth it? Previously one small win used to give me hope to move forward but its been awhile since I had any kind of win in anything. This just makes me even more depressive. Sometimes I feel like talking to someone about what I am going through helps but I can't afford therapy and I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't know what to do anymore."

After recognizing that allowing toxic people in my life for too long screwed up the good relationships I had in my life, I made the choice to be alone, but it had already been too late. My choices and my mental health just pushed everyone away. 

I would reach out for help with depression and sometimes overdo it. Sometimes, I wish I kept to myself and never revealed what was going on. I wish I hadn't met this person in my life that taught me to trust others again because it had just led to much more hurt..

I don't know what to do with my life. I have so many mental health and physical health issues (such as not being able to go outside without proprietary glasses and losing the ability to visualize memories from a brain injury) that I can't see a future for myself. I feel like I am going to have a mental breakdown honestly.

I'm sorry if this was not the right place to post I don't really know where to write this or what to do. I just feel like collapsing and life doesn't make sense. I am losing the little hope I had. Please help :("
398,depression,"how do you actually ""move on""?","It's a long story but, short version :

I have a friend, let's call her Potato. Me and potato is a really great friend would hangout often almost everyday. Then suddenly she stopped.

I went spiraling into my depression, almost ..... Myself.
We talked about it. And fast forwards a couple of months, we are still good friend.
But everytime I saw her, or talk to her, I always got reminded of that time, and almost always brought it up and fester her, no matter how many times we have talked about it.

I'm worried that she might leave me again, because I can't just let it go.

Any advice?"

I dread the day my parents pass but I will rejoice that I can finally do the world a favor and take my life. I think it's best for everyone around me.

402,depression,Where I'm at.,"I've been having a comparatively good summer compared to how I felt last fall and winter, but there's a pretty good chance I'll be cycling back into severe depression later in the year.

Today I made the mistake of looking up old friends. It makes me feel bad in many different ways, but it's for the best that I just focus on my life. It's really messed up how far behind everyone else I am. REALLY far behind. People I grew up with have seem to have ten times the life experience.

My life has been on a razor's edge for as long as I can remember, but I do have somewhat modestly privileged existence in some ways, but if I measure it up to another person's life it's not quite as impressive as I make it out to be.

Throughout all of my failures, I haven't been to devestated by the things that I don't have. But it has been a difficult situation to be in a constant state of loss. It hurts, I get used to it, but then it happens again.

Often when I'm hoping for some relief from the bad feelings, I'm instead facing all the twisted irony that makes my life feel like eternal punishment. I've made it through so far, but I'm getting tired of it."

407,depression,life long struggle just keeps getting harder,"I've dealt with depression and anxiety as far back as I can remember. I had no idea what is was though until I was describing what I was feeling to a coworker one time and she goes ""Maggie, you're depressed and anxious."" I was like, really? Is that what that is? I'd always been high-functioning. Managed to maintain my work/school/life balance. I got on antidepressants and things seemed to get a little better. Then I got into a really toxic relationship in 2015. And the dam burst. Everything I'd been holding back just came barreling through. I was diagnosed with a slew of disorders, depression being one, of course. Of all of them, it's still the one I struggle with the most. I've been on almost every med out there. I've even done TMS. I've had good times, I've had bad times. And honestly, during the height of the pandemic, I was great. And then a breakup a year ago. My mom's health started going downhill and now I have to take care of her. And it all came crashing down. Bit by bit it crumbled away and my control over my life waned quickly. And so now, my job, which I was so good at, I've had to take a medical leave of absence from because I can't handle every day. I can barely get out of bed. Clean. Shower. Brush my teeth. I'm on a waiting list to get into a partial inpatient treatment program at the local psych hospital. I'm really hoping they can do something for me. I wanted to try Spravato but no one around here takes insurance for it. So I struggle to get through each day. I do my hardest not to sleep through each and every day. My friends try so hard to get me out and do things but sometimes it's just so hard. I have zero energy. No spoons. Anyways, just wanted to put my story out there. I'm gonna keep trying, but I'm terrified."

415,depression,When Loneliness Hit,"Idk who has the time to read all this. But if you do, God bless you. I have been feeling depressed on and off for most part of my life. Growing up in a different country, I was bullied in school a lot and that lead to insecurities later in my life. I grew up without a father since I was 5. I grew up in a house with my uncles and my mom for most part of my childhood/early adolescence. Went to high school and was bullied even more. My mom met my American stepfather in 2008 online. In 2010, my mom moved to this country because she wanted a better future for the both of us. A year later I moved here with her. The whole step father experience was weird at first. I could tell my stepfather (Keith) wanted to help me become successful, but never felt the the son-father connection until years years later.  My brother was born in 2010. I always asked my mom for a little brother to play with. When my brother was born I was already 15, but I still loved him and do until this present day. Started high school as a freshman without knowing any English. Met some friends and made the soccer team. My dreams of playing professional were up high then. A year later, My sister was born. I was happy and confused at the same time. Finished my first semester of senior year and starting my second semester, Keith found a new job in another state. We moved to Wyoming and I graduated high school there. Made a few friends then went to university where I made a couple of good friends. My junior year, Keith was diagnosed with cancer. It was devastating news for my mom and siblings. It was then when Keith started showing love to me as a father-son. When I graduated university, I moved home to help mom. I took dad to treatments out of state and developed a strong bond between the both of us. For the first time, I loved Keith and called him dad. He fought hard. Last stages of his life, it was heartbreaking seeing him struggle. He was a good man. One day he had no hope, doctors told him he needs hospice. I watched him die in bed with mom. Unable to help him and feeling hopeless, I watched him drop a tear before he passed. I will never forget that moment. I had flashbacks of all our memories together, and regrets of not bonding with him earlier. For 2 years, and staying at my mom‚Äôs house I couldn‚Äôt find a job after my dad passed. A year go, one of my friends calls me saying he found a job for me at the company he‚Äôs was working at. We both looked for an apartment and moved in. He found a gf soon after we moved and our friendship started to vanish. He is now moving out to a new place and I am starting to look at 1 bed apartment for myself. I have been feeling so lonely and depressed lately. I am in a new state where I know nobody. My mom lives 3 hours away so I visit her every 2 weeks. I am very antisocial and unsecured. These are the reasons I have been feeling depressed about: -Lonely (0 friends)
- lack of motivation to take action and work for my future.
-No luck in meeting that special one. 

My dad always told me I have potential and I am smart, but I am too lazy‚Ä¶ 
I don‚Äôt feel smart and feel hopeless about my future. Sometimes I get so depressed I wonder how the people I know would feel if I stopped existing. I know everyone wouldn‚Äôt care long term and will move on with their lives. I wish I had the opportunity to make friends, people to mentor me in my future. I am 27 and feel like I‚Äôve hit the end of the Road. I spend my days alone at work, home and gym. Don‚Äôt know how to meet people. If you made it this far, I thank you for taking a minute of your time to read this hopeless note about my boring life."

I never put effort into anything during my childhood, I always treated other people like shit and used them for my needs. I gained a hundred pounds in high school so my parents had to pull me out. My parents basically had to pull some strings for me to graduate high school so I don‚Äôt even know where I‚Äôm at in terms of my education.

I feel now like I have the coping skills to now deal with my problems but slowly over these last couple years ive struggled with the idea of being utterly alone. Not entirely in a physical sense more or less but solely emotionally. I've been shutting myself out to the ones I love for years and it's getting to the point now where my pride won't let me open up. My support system is more or less falling apart and it breaks my heart because I'm too prideful anymore to even bring it up. Also more and more over the years, venting about my problems doesn't give me any satisfaction or reassurance knowing that someone knows I'm going through something. Furthering the problem. There are a very few of those people that can relate in their own experiences with their life long mental illness but I feel like there's nothing I can express or explain about myself that makes me feel any better or understand myself anymore than I do and I feel it just furthers my problem in opening up and feeling alone. It's been hard to lower my guard and it's been effecting my drive to find a partner in life. I don't expect any reassurance from anyone, I've never posted really anything about myself on reddit, I've always been a lurker but I want this to be a step into trying to fix this flaw about myself. For the first time in my life I'm actually seeing a therapist soon and I'm excited and relieved to finally get professional guidance.  Thanks everyone ahead of time, I'm just so tired"

440,depression,venting since I haven't done it in a while. (TW: MENTION OF NUD3S),"Recently I thought my life was getting better. I had begun to workout, eat better, got more motivation, and even found an SO. I thought everything was going fine, until my SO invited me into a group chat with his step sister. She called him by a different name than he introduced himself as (we met online and haven't met in person). Whenever we would video call, he never turned facecam on. I figured this was weird. Eventually, he left the group chat, so it was just me and his sister. I asked her if her name was what he told me. She said it was not, but they had a friend with the same name. This was extremely weird. I felt guilty about doubting him at first, but after this confirmation I began to wonder even more. I sent a video he had sent me that I thought was of him (since he claimed it was him), and asked if this was said friend. She said yes. I told her everything, how he was lying about his name, catfishing me, and lying in general. She told me that he has done this before and was actually talking to other women. She also told me that he ""flexed"" that he was only using me for pictures. I'm confused, hurt, and embarrassed. I asked his sister if he had any way to share these pictures to which she said he had little friends, and would likely just share them with her. I sent her more pictures of who the SO claimed to be, and she again confirmed it was the friend. I thought my life was finally getting back on track, but now everything just hurts. We've already broken up, and we are definitely not remaining friends. He's cheated, catfished, lied, and manipulated me. I didn't even realize it. I feel so stupid, even though it's been hours since this has happened. Looking at it now, it was so obvious that he was catfishing, I can't believe I fell for it. What's going to happen to my mental stability? Was I even becoming mentally stable? It felt nice to feel like I was wanted by someone. I think that's what helped me get back into a healthier lifestyle. However, I now know that I wasn't wanted for who I was, but for how my body is. I hate it."
441,depression,My ex was biker in a 1% MC. Also he was my Dom (in a D/s dynamic),"No, I won't be able to find anyone like him. He was everything over wanted. I had so much respect for him , I loved him, would have died for him :'( 

Until the day I got drunk and messed everything up. 

Inside of me I know he deserves better, and he is right about blocking me , I wasn't submissive enough for him and did something which in his club culture is unforgivable. So yes I theoretically understand these things. But how do I move on???

I don't think I can live without him. I would even settle for him to just be my friend. Just to unblock me. 

But he will never do that, because I'm unworthy of it. 

I can't fuking live like this :'("
442,depression,I hope I am able to finally die,"I am very tired as many of you are. I am one of those people who feel like every time I hit rock bottom, I fall deeper. No matter what. I lost the motivation to become a doctor. My career. All the hard hours I‚Äôve put in. Not to mention I am currently employed in healthcare purely to further myself in this particular career path. Something that has caused uncontrollable anxiety. I am ashamed and unfortunately defeated. I am ashamed that I work in healthcare and often find it difficult to find the motivation to help myself. Maybe it‚Äôs because I hate myself; never learning to really like myself. Or maybe it‚Äôs because I had a hard time connecting with my first 2 therapist and our sessions often made me forget about my initial worry and make me fret over something they said instead. For example, I was very distraught when I sought therapy. My last resort because I knew I was dying. I could feel myself become more and more suicidal. I felt directionless yet I knew I needed to do something. I told them that I didn‚Äôt know what to talk about. Just started talking about how I felt in that moment. Overall not well. But strangely enough a lot of the session was silent, awkward, and eventually I asked should I talk about my past? I found myself facilitating more often when I was truly uncomfortable and one part of me didn‚Äôt want help. Just wanted more suffering. Because I‚Äôm not well equipped and sometimes making everyday suffering under the guise of self harm makes it almost appear like I‚Äôm in any sort of control. 

No recent event triggered my symptoms to worsen but rather the accumulation of the pressure to continue living life in addition to poor upbringing. It is a complicated story and dynamic as many relate to but I am currently spending 2 weeks with family. Small being 2 other people but demanding, toxic, painful people to be around and I‚Äôm only speaking for myself. I am not perfect. In my older age but being the youngest of the bunch I have been having a harder time disguising my displeasure, anxiety, and anger from them. Like it would be easier if I continued to cause no problem and enable their behavior and move on. I relocated away as soon as I could to put physical distance between us. If I can survive seeing them twice a year for holidays and seemingly for summers I can deal. But this has been one of the longest trips. One of the most irking. And I think I was in one poorest mental states compared to other times in my life. I think I will be dead before the end of the trip. Toxic family but too difficult to cut off. Not 100% bad people but I have tried speaking to them. Being honest. And being wildly misunderstood and punished. I much rather enable.  For my sake too unfortunately. I could see my many would see me to be in the wrong. I understand. Probably am. 
I‚Äôm ruining my relationship with my bf. Together 6 years. My mental is telling me he doesn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôve seen neglect and mistreatment. He probably would better off without me. I love him so much but we have hurt each other too much. 
I am nothing. But what will it take to finally kill myself. I pray everyday I get the courage and get clouded with emotions. I want to die."
443,depression,The worst part of being depressed is just how alone you feel [lengthy rant incoming],"There is not a single person I think has ever truly understood the full extent of my depression. I've spent my whole life experiencing disappointment after disappointment, traumatic incident after traumatic incident, to the point where I wish I could ""win"" just once. Why can't a single positive experience ever happen to me? Seriously, it's as if I am being perpetually tormented by some sadistic deity. Any time something positive *does* happen, it gets tainted somehow. Here are some examples: A few months ago, I decided to leave the house for the first time in *years* and attend a concert... What happened? I not only end up throwing up right after the concert is over, (and publically humiliating myself in the process) but I also contract an awful case of Covid in the process. Boom! Experience tainted! A few years ago, there was a girl who I thought was into me, but she ended up being an emotionally abusive narcissist who lied to me constantly, talked behind my back, and used me as an emotional punching bag. Boom Experience tainted! THEN, not too long ago, I felt motivated enough to start brushing my teeth again. Except, that same day, I received news that that my mom had a heart attack. This killed any motivation I once had and I still haven't brushed my teeth ever since. Boom! Experience tainted! 

The thing is though, I have no-one to vent to about my frustrations. Everyone I've talked to has either called me ""lazy"" or ""dramatic"" or ""defeatist"" to some extent. I remember I was talking to a very close friend of mine one day and mentioned that I experienced a small emotional breakdown, (He said I can talk to him if anything was troubling me) and he immediately shut me down and tried to change the subject. Not even in a subtle way, just ""I don't want to hear any more of this."" It's not just my friends either, my family is the same way. I told my mom a few days ago about my rotten luck, which she then told my sister. Do you know what my sister said in response? She laughed and called me a ""weirdo"" She didn't even have the audacity to say it to my face, I had to eavesdrop. This is the same person who claimed she also experienced depression at one point. 

Why is it that wherever I go, I'm constantly met with platitudes? It's always my fault somehow. It's my fault that I'm depressed, it's my fault that I'm lonely, it's my fault that I can't cope with stress, my fault that I lack the motivation to do anything but sit around all day, it's always my goddamn fault no matter what. Do you know how much effort I put into simply existing? Why is that so difficult for people to understand? I just feel so alone and isolated, except I'm not allowed to express any of that without everyone making me feel like a piece of garbage. ""Other people have it worse! What do you have to complain about?"" 

I wish I could just... Well, you know."

446,depression,Wish that I manned up at an earlier age,"
I‚Äôm a 20M. My father was an alcoholic and my mother raised me on her own. He was a very weak man and it hurt to see him that way. Instead of using anger I became a doormat. My father was extremely athletic in his youth but did not pursue his talents after high-school. I believe this was part of what ate him alive and why he drank himself to death. I am also athletic and have baseball talent. But I got badly bullied at a late age and made a fuck ton of mistakes based on low self esteem. 

I dropped out of college and I‚Äôm finding that I genuinely have baseball talent. I can hit the shit out of the ball and I love the sport. I have these thoughts of me being on some baseball team and people from the past coming to harass me. I used to seriously be a push over and let people take advantage of me. I‚Äôve always been handsome but I un-ironically didn‚Äôt see it. I took my father being absent very hard for some reason and completely rolled over. I was literally wearing makeup which is so out of character for me. So many people have a bad memory of me in that I was the receiver of abuse. 

I could have avoided being picked on had I just manned up and helped my mom. But I wanted the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù life and ignored my reality. How to recover?"
447,depression,Life problems,I hurt and I been hurting for sometime. I been very secure about it. I know the reason I hurt is very cliche for any men. I been struggling to keep moving forward because the pain feels like it will last a lifetime and that I blame myself because I wasn‚Äôt strong enough to stop the hurt on time. I want to scream my lungs out sometimes but I just scream in silence but I feel my hurt roar. I am not suicidal. I am confuse on myself. I changed a lot and I did it for the wrong reason although at the time it felt like it was what I needed to become to see myself at my peak. But everything begin to crumble. I saw all of it and the most painful thing was that it was like it was slow moving on purpose so I wouldn‚Äôt miss anything and feel every bit of it. I talk to my dog and it helps but I am just talking to myself. I‚Äôm trying to be great I know what I want to become and what I want to mean. I want to be happy the right person but it‚Äôs hard to find someone that‚Äôs right. I‚Äôm not picky but it feels like I want someone to just be understanding and not push for so much change and when I ask for change as well to see actual proof. I am very tired of thinking of myself seeing something in the past. Like it calls to me and it manipulates me but I know it‚Äôs just me and it‚Äôs always been me. I‚Äôm stuck in a loop feeling countless things all at once and it‚Äôs because I put myself below to let someone heal before me. I can‚Äôt even begin to describe myself. I cried tonight for sometime I been holding that and it feels refreshing to have a dog to hear me out and be able to write this without denying that I feel like this. It‚Äôs okay I just want to grow and it‚Äôs been so long since I been alone. It‚Äôs something I need. I was told I could be too tough but that toughness was meant for me only it pushes me when I‚Äôm in situations like this and that‚Äôs why I write this big long paragraph that has very bad punctuation and grammar mistakes but this is me before I climb the big mountain. (Aka not a real mountain)

But it looks like my depression finally claimed my ability to speak. It's not that I don't want to talk, or that I have nothing to say, I desperately want to be able to say stuff, it's like a daily goal at this point. But the most I can get out is a few words before I just can't bring myself to talk for another few hours. 

I'm so worried it's going to affect my friendships, since all of them are used to me being really talkative. The weirdest thing is that nothing has really happened to make me worse or anything, just the usual depression I've had for years. I just can't talk anymore.

466,depression,My life changed over night,"Hello i am 21 years old.
I am living in Germany and my life changed completely over night.
Two weeks before Christmas my best friend and I got together. I felt never such happiness before ( I finally got a relationship, after all the disappointments). I was completely in love and didn‚Äôt wanted to see anyone else except of her. Then on 23 to 24 December we slept over night at my place and we had sex. It was my first time. Everything was fine after that. But in the next morning I had to throw up. It was a little bit with blood and there wasn‚Äôt any food getting out. I didn‚Äôt even felt sick. I just had to throw up. I went to the hospital and this where it all started. I questioned everything and suddenly I wished that I never became that close to her and that I don‚Äôt love her. I panicked extremely because I had to hurt her. I just wished that we were best friends again. After two painful days I told her how I felt. She accepted it and we went back to friends. But I didn‚Äôt felt better after that. It took some day till I could think rationally again. The last 6 months were a completely up and down. Some weeks I am doing good and some weeks I get in a deep hole where I can‚Äôt think straight. She is doing good and also thinks about new men, while I still can‚Äôt accept that we aren‚Äôt mentioned to be together. It literally kills me inside to think about she getting someone new. What happened to me and why am I feeling like not being myself anymore. My theory is that I became depressed over night and that this is the reason why I lost or can‚Äôt feel my feelings for her anymore. To think about hurting her is the worst feeling I ever had. I just wish that we could be together till the rest of our life‚Äôs.

I hope someone can understand me."

Got to hang out with my local  Outlaws chapter (which I still have mad respect for , SYLO &amp; OFFO!!) Learned to ride motorcycles (because I was tired of riding in the back only lol) , did everything I have ever dreamed to ever do, and maybe more.

It felt a lot worse to me personally, but I think there will be people here that could maybe relate? If this does not fit the sub, I would be glad if anyone could tell me where I could post. I want to get this out!)


First of this is tough for me to write, because it was a situation happening to me in Fall of last year (maybe starting end of August or beginng of September, I do not remember)! There were so many things to all of this, I will try to focus on the majore ones and keep it basic. 

I really hope somebody can give me tips evaluating this whole situation and maybe someone can relate. Thanks to a of you!


So as I got really bad in the second half of last year, but my feelings date back a couple more months. I was in a relationship with my first girlfriend. It was rocky. It was probably really toxic and very likely mainly my fault. A good friend of mine is in a relationship with my exes best friend. 

I did not feel to loved in the relationship and also knew I had to work on my sudden bursts of rage/anger. I went to a Therapist for this problem. It felt like a fight just ""beeing enough"" for my former ex. (Reflecting I think it's stupid, she loved me, it was my problem)

It came to a point where I felt really uncomfortable. Hating my physical appearance, how unsuccessful I am at university, and not having to interesting hobbies. Those things tore me apart and made me put alot of pressure on myself. I started to feel less and less like myself.  I told my then gf, that I can't handle the relationship any longer nger if we do BOTH try to fix it and also told her how bad my mental state became. 

In that phase I already started trying to tell my friends that ""something is off"". I was just working on autopilot. Everything I was doing felt like I was doing for my girlfriend, when I had time for me alone I was just spending it for myself, feeling terrible. 

After just a little fight we broke up a couple of weeks later. I met another girl just 4 days later, had a good time with her. But all the pressure was still there and my ex wanted me (surprisingly) back. 

I felt really guilty back then but felt like I was doing the right thing (leaving atoxic relationship for a new girl, could have pulled it of better definitely!), but it felt like a lot of people were putting blame on me, so I cut ties to them. 

One night I met with my ex and somehow ended up in bed with her. To this day I don't know how this happened and why I did it. We have not had sex for 2years at that point. I felt terrible it felt terrible, but I somehow could not leave the situation. 

I told the girl I was seeing at the time 2 days later....that was fucking shitty of me! I should have told her immediately. She did not want to see me again and stopped any contact with me. 


And this is the crucial point. After having sex with my ex girlfriend I felt so terrible, confused, guilty, angry, I don't know I did not sleep, eat or do anything. I started to fear basically everyone. Got paranoid, dogs were scarry as hell. I imagined hearing staps behind my back, etc. 

I still wonder what this was and what happened there. It felt like a climax to a situation I was stuck in for months. It felt like I could have predicted it coming. Even before it happening it felt like my actions and my persona were not matching anymore (and I could not change it somehow?). It felt terrible. I have to this day not really spoken with anyone about the events happening last year and I feel like I will just look like the ass even thought I tried to apologize to everyone. My Ex, the girl I was seeing, my best friend.


I would love to hear from anyone that has been in a similar situation!"

But I just... can't.

I'm in a place in my life where I don't even know why I'm here anymore. I don't want to die but I am questioning why anymore. I'm just drowning again and again and even sleep which normally givese some semblance of rest is either very short or me having nightmares. I feel like a parasite in that for the longest time the only ones I can vent to is a few of my friends, but even they have their own issues and I just keep piling on top of them. I'm a disgusting person and I don't even know if I can change that.

I'm just here I guess, I have nothing to look forward to anymore. I am barely functioning and I've almost given up hope to ever get the help people keep saying I need. I need it, I desperately do, yet a combination of my own fears in opening up to a therapist and my lack of any money is just gonna kill me, I guess.

Sorry you had to read this. God, I don't even know why I vented here but I'm just desperate, I need to yell at something and I can't in good conscience do it to my friends anymore. I can't."

482,depression,Wtf is wrong with me,"I keep going back to this feeling, I can't escape it. At first I thought it was because of my lifestyle, drugs, videogames, lonely, Dopamin addicted loser.

No Matter how much I improve tho I keep on coming back to this exact moment of pain. It's a cycle of insanity. The pain gives me an self improvement push, because I do everything in my power to escape it, I feel better for a while and then it slowly creeps in.

It gets worse and worse everytime tho, my perception of it starts to change. It's like a overload in my stomach, it hurts so deep, but a side of me enjoys it. It's almost paradoxically euphoric. Like so much pain it creates an euphoric feeling, weird af.

I have the urge to do something, just something to escape it, something to escape my life. I can't take this routine anymore, I can't take these people here anymore even tho I love them. I just wanna run away, I just wanna go train hopping or some crazy shit, travel around the world.

I wanna go all in, do some fucked up shit like rob a bank (ofc without hurting anyone), win win situation, either I have money to run away with or I kill myself. It's just an urge tho, drugs helped numb down that urge to do something crazy, but now idk what does. I feel like a neutron star is inside of my stomach.

I just want to be loved, I just want to have someone in my life I can trust, I just want to have family, I just want to experience true love once in my life, not this fake stimulation shit all around me. I want the memories to stop, I want to go out of this fucked up home, I want to stop being poor.

Someday when this feeling returns I'm gonna take the next train to nothingness"

I‚Äôm smack dab in the middle of one of these episodes, its one of the worst episodes ive had by far, its been 3 and  a half months so far. I want to reach out and explain myself to those who im worrying with my silence but I find myself at a loss for words everytime, I get afraid they‚Äôll resent me for needing space, so I avoid these conversations. So it makes the isolation worse. I dont know why Im like this, and I fucking hate myself because I know im stressing everyone out, im hurting the people around me bc i cant act like a functioning person for two seconds. I dont even know if me ghosting people is a depression thing anymore, or if im just a shitty person. It might be for the best if i just let these friendships spare them the trouble yknow, sorry i probably just sound dumb or something"

486,depression,Life as a caregiver,"Just wanted to see if there are any other caregivers out there struggling, whether it's for your parents or kids. 

I took care of a parent but I am now the mother of two severely autistic children. The younger is aggressive. 

I am just sitting on the couch crying because I took something he wasn't supposed to have, he chomped my arm..now there's a massive bruise and bite marks. We've been up since 3:30. It's like this a lot. Up at odd hours. I go to bed anxious because I never know how much sleep I'll get. 

The all day long screaming..the endless tantrums. He is 5 years old. I've been a parent for 8 years. I am just so tired of this life and wish I could escape. 

My husband and I live separate lives. We are isolated. For the first time in years, we had someone offer to help this weekend.. just 2 hours away and I felt human again. But, that'll be it. We are back to hell with school being the only reprieve from this waking nightmare this fall. If we want to spend any time together he has to miss work.

His family doesn't help or have anything to do with us because they're pieces of shit. His parents only have time for their daughter and their ""normal"" grandkids. 

I am trying to get Medicaid in my state through the children's waiver but so far it's been hours of Zoom calls and paperwork and there's only a few hundred slots for the state for behavioral and medical, it is always waitlisted. 

I don't want to die but I definitely don't want to live. Not like this. If I can't get this waiver, this is just my life unless the younger magically improves. I'm sick of my house. No friends. Hopeless future. Dead marriage. 

Everybody screams ""respite!"" I am trying to get it. For the love of God, people need to understand it is not just given out..not even if your child has severe behaviors. You are basically just left to deal with it and hope for the best. 

I wish every single day I could warp into my 25 year old body and have a single visit with my present self, so she could see just how horrible everything gets."

490,depression,I fear that i will never be in a loving relationship.,"This is a bit of a rant because i didn‚Äôt really know exactly what to say so it‚Äôs a bit long.
TLDR: I do not think that i will be able to be  in a loving relationship with anyone and it‚Äôs making me a bit sad.

I‚Äôm in high school and yes i know it‚Äôs very early and i still have my entire life but based on how things have been my entire life so far, and with no sight of change in the future, i don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to be in a serious relationship, or even in a casual one (dating). It‚Äôs not because i am a rude person, i just have terrible social skills, and i am not very good looking. I was popular at my old school but i switched schools and now i am less popular. But even at my old school the thought of anyone girl liking me didn‚Äôt or seem possible, and it still doesn‚Äôt. My plan for daring was to start in college because i think my chances would be better, but it‚Äôs not like i don‚Äôt want to date now. I just don‚Äôt think that i can. I just do not think it‚Äôs likely that anyone would seek me out over anyone else to date. I oftentimes find myself lying in bed at night just imaging hanging out with a girlfriend, nothing sexual or inappropriate, just hanging out. Even in movies when i see people hug or kiss i feel something. It‚Äôs hard to describe the feeling but it‚Äôs sort of emptiness because it‚Äôs like looking at something that you really want, but will never have. I know i am probably just being dramatic and it will turn out ok for me but i have never really liked anyone that way and even if i did the chances that would someone would like me back, or even going out with me if i asked them are slim to none in my mind. My family life is very good, i have Avery good relationship with my parents and my friends. Not to toot my own horn but i am sort of the ‚Äúfunny‚Äù friend in my friend group but i still prefer to be alone and am an introvert. I am also very good at sports. I just don‚Äôt know how i would even talk to someone i liked. Whoever someone new comes into a group, or anyone me know any situation, i have no idea how to talk to them. In my own friend group i am very outgoing, and i kind of talk a lot. But if it‚Äôs anyone not in my friend group i shut down and try to escape the situation. Because of this, I just don‚Äôt see a loving relationship anywhere near in the future, and i am sad about it. I know that i need to be more outgoing but i am definitely getting better. Again, i am definitely being over dramatic about this but it‚Äôs a though i have had for a long time and i just need advice. Although i have very good relationships with my family and friends, i am a very private person and i really hate talking about this type of stuff around anyone so if i have a problem i just keep it to myself and i can do that but i just need to talk about this problem. Anything helps."
491,depression,I want to die,"I'm a heartbroken coward with ptsd, awful grades who constantly lets people down and screws everything up. Nothing is fun anymore.

I keep hoping someone will understand
Or want to I guess
I just want someone to care
That feels selfish
But it feels selfish to be alive

And have person to want me to exist as well

I keep wanting to accomplish something but everything feels beyond me to accomplish 
I wanted to be here

496,depression,i feel worthless and stuck,"im going into my 3rd year of uni but i technically only have 7 college credits because i kept dropping all my classes midway through every quarter and wasting thousands of dollars due to constant unprecedented stress, being overwhelmed, not knowing what i really want to do with my life, etc. and now im panicking about how late i'll be graduating because my family's financial situation is exponentially going downhill right now and my parents are entirely relying on me to be the one to finish college ASAP so i can get a job and support the family's finances, but that in itself is stressing me out even more since i cant even get into the extremely competitive major i need, and every single class  i need to take is major-restricted but i keep getting denied from the major despite trying so hard so i can't even move forward with trying to graduate until i can manage to get in and my parents are constantly yelling at me and down talking me for taking so long in school and for not 'finishing in 4 years like all the other kids' and even though i know everyone goes at their own pace and such, it's still stressful and doesn't feel good getting constantly talked down on like that. 

im always being told i'm ungrateful, lazy, etc. even though i genuinely try my hardest to be a genuine and good person, to be realistic and driven about my academics and career, to do the best i can do for myself and my family, and i really do think i was raised very well but my parents seem to completely disagree and it hurts. my parents are asian so there's no room for understanding on mental health and they pretty much think i am just ungrateful and lazy and it is extremely difficult to be around them because all they ever do is talk down on me, yell at me, tell me im doing something wrong. 

and then i just get even more stressed out because i feel guilty for not being close to my family at all and i always daydream about how close we used to be and i feel like a terrible child for distancing myself so much to the point of barely being able to make small talk with them but when i try to be closer with them, they always just always have reasons to make me feel like shit with their words and it always feels like it's on purpose. there's never anything nice to say about me and im tired of it because i genuinely try my best.

i never raise my voice at them, i don't try to argue with them, i don't ever try to disagree with them. but for example one time my dad confronted me about dropping out of the pre-med path they pressured me to go into and when i tried to explain that my new major would make me much happier and that it was a very practical career choice, they only kept criticizing me to the point of me crying, and then they got extremely angry at me and yelled at me even more for crying and 'not talking to them like an adult'. that's how the majority of our conversations go, i am literally not allowed to show emotion or any sign of disagreement or else i'm yelled at for being disrespectful and immature.

besides all the family stuff, it feels like my entire life no matter where i am or what my circumstances are, it feels like i can never catch a break and everywhere in my life there are issues, stress, things i can't control and no matter how hard i try to take control of my life it just feels so out of reach and hopeless. i can't even go to therapy because i don't have insurance and i barely even have the money for rent, tuition, and food.

 im outcasted and talked down on at my job despite trying to hard to be extremely kind to everyone and perform my best (can't afford to quit since it's the highest paying job i've ever gotten and possibly could get as of now), i have years of eating disorder history that i'm still trying to heal from, i practically have no friends besides my boyfriend despite trying so hard to put myself out there so im pretty lonely. and speaking of, i feel so guilty because from all of this, i've been accidentally projecting all my stresses and depression and frustration out on my boyfriend which i absolutely hate myself for because he's such an angel and a literal golden retreiver of a man. before any suggestions are put out: i have hobbies, i'm not entirely friendless, i know how to be independent and enjoy my time alone, i can't afford to go to therapy, i just don't know what to do or how to process or handle all of this.

tl;dr - endless amount of massive and small stressors in my life and i just feel hopelessly stressed and worthless and i don't know what to do."
497,depression,Feeling like a bag of shit,"I am not a good person, I push and hurt people I care about. 

I have a sister that is 3 years older and she doesn‚Äôt have a perfect life but everyone loves her. Lately she has been doing really good I should be happy for her, but instead it makes me jealous. She can charm anyone and everyone loves her. 

I‚Äôve been feeling quite depressed. So I have been making negative comments. I truly do hate living but don‚Äôt have the guts to end it. I hate to wallow in pity but that seems to be what I do. I know that I could change and help myself, yet I don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs why my ex broke up with me. He felt like he was hitting his head against the wall. 

Today is my birthday and all I did was cry. My little siblings texted me and said Happy Birthday. My sister that is three years older didn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt blame her. 

She is probably done with me too. That‚Äôs fine if people feel like they need to cut me off so be it. They have to do what‚Äôs best for themselves. I wouldn‚Äôt want to be around me either. 

The level of empathy I have is gone. I just feel numb inside and angry, tired. 

Sometimes I want to slap myself to get it together. To get my shit together, to exercise, eat well and then my depression will get better. Yet I don‚Äôt have the Will to do so. 

I get so tired of living. I know people love me but I also know that you can love someone and not let them be in your life. I feel like a useless nobody. 

I want to change so badly yet I don‚Äôt. I hate myself yet I know I should have more sympathy toward myself. 

This shit is fucking hard. I feel so lonely. I just wish I could turn the switch and I could be better. Do better. 

This is just a rant."
498,depression,Feeling resentful and depressed over a demotion.,"I am switching from an employment agency to direct contract. The job I have is okay and not very stressful. But the pay sucks, for some reason the EA overestimated my job title and paid me $200 more than before.

I was free from depression for more than a year. I was ready to give my all and add value at work. But the recent announcement made me really really upset and depressed. How am I going to survive a $200 cut on a already low salary? 

There aren't many good prospects out there for an alternative job and I don't want to go through the experience of applying and being rejected over and over again. On the bright side, the job isn't toxic. I just feel I am not adequately compensated.

This cut was of no fault of my own, not the EA's, but perhaps HR's policy pegging wages based on education level and work experience. 

It is depressing. The thought hijacks my mind so often even if I try my best to escape from it."
499,depression,what the hell everyone is depressed even people with good lives,"Alot of  posts on people ready to off themselves, usually have pretty good lives.

I am literally a fucking loser never had a girlfriend, dropped out of college have no social life. My parents which where a cause of me having such a shitty life, think I am being lazy piece of garbage for no having accomplished anything. Mom disappointed I don't have kids like its my fucking fault I cant get a GF. Literally no one in my life is cheering me on everyone just thinks I am trash and no this isn't me thinking it. I know for a fact they talk behind my back on how much of a loser I am. 

I used to believe if I had those missing ingredients in my life I wouldn't be so sad and depressing. Only to find out about people who have one or the other. Ready to pull the trigger damn life is a fucking joke. I used to want to kill myself, but now I realize how how stupid that is. I am tired of being sad because society programed me into thinking I need a girlfriend, money, friends, screw all that. 

I am just gonna be me from now on, no longer scared of what others think of me fuck the world. Ill figure out how to make myself happy even if it the stupidest shit ever. I recommend everyone else does the same."

As if my girlfriend will just dump me for being too lame and needy or that my employer will see me as useless.

I have emotionally abusive parents who make me feel like shit for wanting more out of life. Anytime they have a complaint, they drag it into a 10 minute discussion about how I am selfish or lazy. Today they were yelling and arguing with me because of a bar of soap. I know, it‚Äôs totally bizarre. All I could think to myself while they were yelling at me was ‚Äútheir worldview is myopic.‚Äù My dad threatened to throw me out.

Sometime I wish I could die. I know it wouldn‚Äôt solve anything, but sometimes the thought is comforting. I just hate feeling this way.

I'm tired of giving all my energy to someone that can't commit or match me. I don't feel loved. I want to be loved in the way I love them. I don't know if I'm asking too much or I'm being selfish. I did feel loved. I felt love like I haven't felt in years. The funny thing is it was when I was overdosing. The tears that fell on my face gave me warmth and something to hold on to as I struggled to breathe. I wish I got the same energy and compassion at other points In life. It's now almost a week later. I'm dealing with the after effects with missing work and my car broke down too. I asked my partner for help because the thoughts are back but they committed to playing Xbox with their sibling so I said I'd just be okay by myself. They just asked me to please not self harm.

516,depression,High risk Jobs To Kill Me,"I kept grieving not being able to give years of my life to someone who wanted it. When I wasn't so sick, I dreamed of becoming a physician to help the thousands of homeless I saw suffering in Baltimore City. I no longer plan on living that long, nor do I have the passion or motivation to make it anymore. 

One night, while wandering Baltimore city at 1 am, stranded with a broken car, looking for a man to help me open my oil cap, I felt fear but I felt alive too. It felt powerful. I was almost fearless, approaching people, wanting help with my car but also hoping they'd end my life. The adrenaline was sick. 

I changed my direction in life. I want to enter a high-risk field, one where I could be shot or killed. We need people to enter these fields, and I want to help people. I'd be happy to use my mental state to help people, all while living an adrenaline-filled shortened life with a purpose.

Unfortunately, I am small and not that useful (female, 5'3"", 107 pounds). Thus, I can't see myself in the police force, army, electrician, or fire-fighter. I can see myself as a paramedic possibly? EHS? I know it sounds stupid, but I'm very positive there are jobs with dangerous environments that aren't just brute labor-oriented.

I don‚Äôt get satisfaction from anything that I would say I love, singing, playing piano, because I can‚Äôt be satisfyingly good enough. Food and shows and games just don‚Äôt seem entertaining and enough to make me want to live. I have no meaningful relationships or people that have me and only me. I don‚Äôt have anything to truly look forward to. I don‚Äôt look forward to anything but escape, and that isn‚Äôt life getting better, it‚Äôs just getting less worse. I can‚Äôt see myself happy in 10 years and I can‚Äôt think of a good way for my future to go. I can‚Äôt imagine loving someone or being loved currently, and don‚Äôt even feel a desire. I used to believe in afterlife and karma and I still kind of do but right now I‚Äôm just hoping death is a complete end and darkness that I would normally be scared of. I don‚Äôt really want help because I just want it to end and I know help is just going to be a whole lot of convincing. I can‚Äôt see myself happy in any future scenario, I don‚Äôt think anything would make me happy. I don‚Äôt think anything brings me pleasure at the moment. If I could get meds and be happier with chemicals I would do it but I know it‚Äôs not really simply possible to get those meds and continuously take them without consequences in my current situation, so I don‚Äôt see the point. I‚Äôm starting to realize that I‚Äôm the problem, not that I‚Äôm problematic or a bad person, at least I hope I am not, but maybe the way my brain is wired, I know that whatever situation I am in I will not be happy. I get what I look forward to but it does not really make things better and I will just be seen as ungrateful. Maybe it‚Äôs because it was escape like I said before, and I didn‚Äôt really get put in a good position, just a not as bad one."

I can't get any school work done I've stopped doing things I like to do (other than write but I do that in bed) and I have stopped hanging out with friends so often.

I have troubles with sleep. I never sleep enough, I always stay up way to late. I do this because I love the way night feels. It's calm I have no responsibility I have no one to fake happiness in front of. I feel tired and can focus during the day but at night time I'm more awake than even.

I feel sort of numb. I can't remeber the last time I felt anything other than well nothing. I feel stress but other than that it's just nothing. I don't know what this is but I hate it

538,depression,Having the hardest time,"I'm really struggling. I'm dealing with ADHD, depression, anxiety, and probably some remaining symptoms of my bygone BPD diagnosis. I struggle so much with executive dysfunction, especially when it comes to school. And I only took ONE CLASS this semester to make things easier on myself, but I still managed to fail it. I just couldn't bring myself to do the work these last few months. I'm so anxious and upset with myself.


I'm supposed to be getting married this year, but my fiance is at or near his wit's end with me. He needs me to manage myself better, and I'm trying, but I feel like I can't do anything. We live in the middle of nowhere and I can't drive, so I can't get a job here to help pull my weight. He doesn't know I failed my class and I'm scared to tell him because, as he's always reminding me, it's my only real responsibility. I'm so ashamed of myself and scared that I won't be able to get better so I'll lose him.


I recently self-harmed for the first time in years. I've also been having suicidal thoughts. I used to see a DBT therapist, but they're not covered under Medicaid, so I don't have anyone to talk to about the things going on with me. All I ever want to do is sleep. I weaned myself off the highest dose of Vyvanse back in January, and it's made things so hard. I've gained a bunch of weight (a massive trigger for me), I can't focus on anything, and I'm constantly tired (sometimes I sleep for 12+ hours at a time, only to feel groggy the rest of the day). I'm depressed. I know I need to see a GP, a psychiatrist, and a therapist, but I've just turned 26 and I no longer have insurance through my parents. I enrolled for Medicaid, but I don't understand the system and haven't been able to bring myself to find doctors through the Medicaid portal. It also doesn't help that I'm moving out of state next month and will likely have to sign up all over again.

I'm sad and scared. I don't know how to get better. I don't even feel like I have the resources to get better."

540,depression,"I didn't think i had depression anymore, but I'm getting bad vibes that it's coming back but I dont feel depressed like I use to","I was diagnosed with depression when I was 16. I ran away from home at 17 after being in an abusive household and being R'd many times as a younger teen. It was extremely hard to deal with, especially with being on my own and learning about a world I wasn't allowed to learn about as a kid.
It took years to get over and many break throughs that what happened to me was not okay. I couldn't get out of bed back then. I had no want to do anything except bawl my eyes out. I even stopped drawing for an entire year (life long artist) and had to relearn everything when I went back to it.

I thought it was over. I felt so much better. I cut my dad permanently out of my life, and my mother and I have grown a great relationship after she accepted her faults with what happened during my teen years. She so wonderful now and truly tries. My fiance is the most supportive man in the world and does so much for me, and I him.

My problem - I started not sleeping again. At first it was just staying up a little later than normal, but now I'm up till the early hours in the morning and just take short naps during the day. It makes me feel so gross and sick. I feel all over again that there is something wrong with me. Im so stressed with everything.

I'm going to the doctor soon to talk about it, but I'm scared to be told I need to be evaluated again. I do not want to go through any of that process again, I dont want to deal with tears and hidden emotions. I just want to work and be happy with myself. I dont have the time to be worrying about my body or sleep.

Can anyone give me some advice on what could maybe help me in this time? I haven't experienced sleep deprivation this bad before, and worrying about if it's a sign of my depression coming back is making me feel worse and is keeping me up even later"

543,depression,I haven‚Äôt felt happy in a long time. Please help.,"I‚Äôm 19 years old. I‚Äôm laying down in bed and I‚Äôve been crying for an hour. My thoughts have been spiraling and it‚Äôs making me really upset. Recently, I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about my lack of friends, my intense social anxiety, my body, everything. Most of my friendships fell apart last year because of my depression. I have to get a job but it just seems so overwhelming. 

I keep thinking about how if I were to disappear only my immediate family and one friend would realize I‚Äôm missing. I don‚Äôt plan on doing anything to myself because I don‚Äôt want the people I love to go through that pain, but it just sucks knowing I have so few people who care about me. I go to college but I don‚Äôt have any friends there, and last semester some people were really mean to me undeservingly. I try to be friendly, but nothing I do really leads to any sort of relationship. I get embarrassed about 80% of my social interactions, I‚Äôm super self-conscious, I just wish I wasn‚Äôt here.

I‚Äôve felt so disconnected from reality for a long time, and I‚Äôve felt super depressed this past week, and on and off since I was 13. I work out occasionally, I read, play video games, do art, take my dog for walks, I do so many things that are supposed to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me but nothing works. I‚Äôm so tired. I‚Äôm exhausted of living like this, I just want to feel normal again. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to get back to a more normal state of mind? Please don‚Äôt say go to therapy or go to the gym, I‚Äôm sick of those answers. If you have personal anecdotes, can relate, or have any advice please comment. I hope someone sees this because I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore."

546,depression,How to stay productive?,"Tl;dr How can I stay productive after coming out of a depressive episode?

So I‚Äôve been doing a really bad job managing my life these past months. My biggest problem had been cleaning my room. I had not cleaned in a month, and I had piles of dirty laundry, trash laying around bc I was too lazy to put a trash bag in my trash can, a bunch of papers for school and work. Today I suddenly found the inspiration to clean it and it felt so good to do it. I feel a big weight off my shoulders.

The thing is I know I won‚Äôt always feel inspired like today. And this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve had really bad episodes, but I‚Äôm scared of completely losing inspiration one day. I want to be able to stay consistent with things I have to do, and want to do. 

I‚Äôve also grown more anxious about time. While I was cleaning I found my old writing and drawing journals that I loved working on. I also found a candle that a friend gifted me for Christmas, and it was a candle for Taurus season (4/20 to 5/20). I remember telling myself that I would light it when the season starts. When I found the candle today, I realized how the season had already ended, and I just felt a wave of sadness upon knowing how much time has passed and feeling like I‚Äôm wasting it.

I have a lot of goals and dreams, yet I can‚Äôt seem to work for them. I just waste so much time everyday feeling miserable. Are depressive episodes inevitable? Will I always have them? If yes, how can I better manage them? They‚Äôre just ruining my life but I can‚Äôt control it and it just feeds into my hopelessness.

I wanted to vent a bit, so you guys can ignored the ranting bit. But I do wanna know if anyone knows any tips on how to stay productive? What has worked for you?"

550,depression,I don't know if this is depression or not,"Generally, I wouldn't think of myself as depressed since I don't have most, if any, of the symptoms. However, when i went to a therapist a few years ago she said that I have it and that some of my words are a unconscious cry for help. I suffered (still suffer from, but not as severe as back then) from OCD and my life at the time was not that great. I didn't realize how miserable I was until it all crashed down in 2021 when I was at my worst. 


Anyway, shortly after it crashed down and I was recovering from that, I discovered that (at least the time) I was very excited at being at risk of physical harm. I was terrified of sitting on a motor cycle but after experiencing it (I was on the back seat) I loved it so much, I wanted to drive one on a highway. I got stung by a jellyfish and it was agonizing but after a while I had the wish to swim with one of those gigantic jellyfish.


Last but not least, the cigarette. I was smoking a cigarette but it quickly went out because of the temperature and wind conditions. Since I wasn't sure whether it was still burning deep withing or not, I pressed the cigarette butt with my thumb. I felt nothing on my thumb. So I pressed it again and then again and again."

Being very frank and honest about my depression journey and what I‚Äôve been doing the last few years (not much was the answer to what I‚Äôve been doing‚Ä¶not much). And then very shortly after that I break up with this guy I dated for such a short period of time who really made me feel something. Made me feel alive for the first time in a long time. Made me so happy. But it ended kind of bad‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think he was mature enough for a relationship yet. And I‚Äôve been feeling sorry for myself for weeks now because I‚Äôm so hurt because this didn‚Äôt work out‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm watching this comedy special and it‚Äôs bringing up and honoring comedians like robin williams and Richard Pryor and‚Ä¶I personally love stand up comedy. I love to watch entertainment that makes me laugh. And in one of the few monologues that were given they were talking, many times, about the healing power of laughter. 

You have to be able to laugh at what goes on in the world. Even the dark stuff. Life is too short to take everything so seriously. To hang onto every negative feeling and get lost in that, and wallow, and get stuck there.

It‚Äôs hard to realize when you‚Äôre in it‚Ä¶Ik it‚Äôs so hard. But I used to live my life more like a comedian‚Ä¶to try to find the humor in the things that happen in my life.

560,depression,What is the literal point in living?,"Seriously, you wake up, you force yourself to do whatever hygienic rituals you need to do before actually getting on with your day, maybe that burns thirty minutes to an hour tops-and for pretty much everyone over the age of 10 that usually becomes a rushed ritual where you feel you never actually have enough time and are trying to make whatever bullshit you have laid out in front of you‚Ä¶

So on to that bullshit in front of you, you go to school or work, something forced upon your will that you can‚Äôt decline doing, as it‚Äôs something that simply ‚Äúneeds to be done‚Äù in pretty much every form of society known to modern man on this planet. You get through whatever horse shit you need to, and then what? 

You perhaps engage in trivial relationships that don‚Äôt last or give you the false hope of something meaningful in your life. Maybe you have sex which is a fleeting pleasure before it‚Äôs over and you are thrust back into the usual rhythm of your life. 

Maybe you have some hobbies you take part in that don‚Äôt actually mean anything beyond the false belief that they hold some form of value rather than picking things to waste away time that you wouldn‚Äôt be spending doing nothing just ticking down the seconds your life is wasting away. Maybe you take part in said hobbies to attract partners to have said relationships and sex with in some diminutive, round-about effort to tie together any meaning at all to the worthless, time wasting shit you might take part in that you believe acts as an identity to your existence. The people you wish to attract have even less substance, believing just because you‚Äôre a shmuck doing some bullshit all of a sudden they take an interest in you and decide to give you a shot at engaging in a more-than-average interaction. 

Just what the fuck is even the point? It‚Äôs all so fucking stupid, shallow, and meaningless. If life isn‚Äôt meant to be analyzed so deeply and just ‚Äúenjoying the ride‚Äù, what is there to even enjoy? Getting lost in the transparency of it all? Turning a blind eye to the nothingness of the average day? Filling your schedule with aloof activities that are brainless and not meaningful in any way shape or form, just for the sake of filling time before old age and death?

Fuck, it just makes no sense to me how any of that can make people happy. It just comes off as people tricking themselves that what they‚Äôre doing is meaningful in any way. 

And then when people such as myself voice this, they say I‚Äôm just a doubter, I‚Äôm just negative, or I‚Äôve got issues, I should see a therapist, if only I could ‚Äòsee the forest for the trees‚Äô, or people feel bad for me that I‚Äôm ‚Äòmissing out‚Äô on life having such pessimistic views.

I just fucking hate life. I want to tell everyone about it too. I wish for those who claim to have found happiness to tell me why they think their life is actually worth living."

I do imagine it sometimes though, and through that I can see the consequences I would face if I go through. Like, the pain of my parents, the way I have to face God (suicide is forbidden in my religion). I feel confused because I don't know how to deal with my emotions. I currently have no outlet to express them as my friends are equally stressed with exam season. I would say, I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill as I've always tend to exaggerate my problems. I find it worrying that I constantly seek death and self destructive ways during this period. I've been trying my best to calm my thoughts to the point I can't start studying for my next exam. I've broke down multiple times this exam week and held myself back from cutting. I am just an ordinary person, with a good life.....so why must I feel this way....my friend told me it might be because I'm constantly exposed to the trauma of others. People used to vent to me about their suicidal, depression problems very descriptively and I never stopped them, afraid that they wouldn't be able to express it and it would get worse for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been feeling this horrible feeling of sadness deep within me, every time I'm no longer in contact with a person. When I'm with someone, I can rely on their energy to be happy and keep the mood. I hope I'm happy during those times....if i wasn't....that would be sadder. These thoughts and feelings started before my exams were close. I know it's mostly because of my overthinking, but I don't know how to stop it. I only escape to social media, stories, movies, etc. At this point, I'm just trying every healthy way possible to escape it and be a normal person so I don't burden anyone."

Even though i was pursuing what i thought id wanted to do my whole life, i didn‚Äôt feel like me. once covid started to spread and the school i was attending shut down i tried to focus more on finding myself but ended up more lost and depressed than before. i made some insane decisions, and while i regret none of it, i wished that i had actually learned from them. i have been in the same pattern for the last 3years at least. and nothing but negativity has come from it. no matter how many times i try to break free i feel powerless as i watch myself subconsciously fall into the same patterns over and over again. i got married in january 2022 and spent the first few months of my marriage homeless with my husband. we are finally in a place but our marriage is struggling. i don‚Äôt feel happy and i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm not happy with him or if i‚Äôm unhappy all around. i don‚Äôt feel like he cares about me. i worked so hard to get us into the place we are in now but now that we are here i‚Äôm doubting if i made the right choice. i don‚Äôt feel like he understands just how hard this is for me. we just moved from the only place i‚Äôve ever lived to a city 3.5+hrs away from any of my family. i have no friends, im struggling to find a new job, money is tight, and i don‚Äôt have any will to live. he doesn‚Äôt seem to think about me anymore and seems uninterested in the words that i have to say. i just want things to get better."
569,depression,Why don't I care about people?,"I'll start off with saying that I do care immensely about animals, always have, so I don't think it's entirely a lack of empathy. Also when I was younger I do remember caring more about others, my grandma's death being the last time I really remember caring about anyone (10 years ago). But now, I just don't. For instance my mom has cancer and I haven't had a single emotion about it. She also injured her shoulder and I have to help her do things, and all I can think about is how I would rather be doing anything else and how she's just whining for attention. Sounds mean, but it's just my thought process. I honestly don't think there's even one human on earth that I would be sad about them dying. But my dog, yeah I'd never get over it as I haven't with every dog I've ever had that died.

I'm really only happy when I'm alone. My ""boyfriend"" I haven't talked to in over a week. I just don't care. All I want is to live in the middle of nowhere and have a bunch of animals and not talk to people. Everything anyone does irritates me, I have no idea how to talk to people and if anyone talks about anything other than animals I just stop talking to them because I find other topics super boring, pointless and irrelevant.

I often wonder if I'm a sociopath, something Ive been called by others many times. But I think my love for animals rules that out. I'm really curious what my problem is and if I should do something about it or just continue working toward my goal of being a hermit on a farm lol"
570,depression,I just have a fuck you moment from the universe.,"Recently just got myself a pet and i even managed to get my dying snapdragon to grow and bloom again.. Only to have my pet got his feet injured, stress pooping and my entire pot of plant yeeted off from my balcony window.

571,depression,Just want to write down my feelings - boyfriend[25] has depression,"My partner has been struggling with depression and anxiety since he was a teenager. Dad was absent most of the time during childhood, past toxic relationships, being bullied at school...

Now things have been getting harder because of Covid and difficulties in his work.

He told me he's been thinking about killing himself but he said he couldn't do it and won't do it because that will hurt his parents. It's the only one thing he can't do this life.

Now he's working but feels like being treated like a dog by the employers. He says ""I feel like I‚Äôm in a fishbowl, looking out at the world where everything is beautiful outside, but I can‚Äôt escape...""

He says I don't understand how he feels and he feels betrayed because I'm just like everyone else... All I've been trying to do is just to be there for him. But I can only do so much to help. I can't 100% relate to his feelings because I guess I'm the few lucky ones who don't have those problems in life. All I can tell him is just that I'm here whenever he needs me. That's all. 

I've been encouraging him to go to therapy, I think he's still considering it, he's done it before but probably didn't feel it's helpful enough. Sometimes I don't know when's the best time to bring it up. When we're having a good time and great conversation? Or when he's feeling depressed? I don't know...I want to help him find a good therapist.

I'm taking care of my own feelings at the same time. I just wish I could help him feel a little better. I wish he sees the beauty I see in him."

573,depression,"Constant misery, constant chest pain","Hello everyone. To preface this: May 2022 has been the most emotionally difficult month of my life. At the end of April my gf broke up with me. Her last message was her listing off every time I was being ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù and ‚Äúrequired her support‚Äù, even though I thought that we managed to get over all of these episodes. Then my grandmother died. She was at home with us (my family and I), I saw the life fade from her eyes. A few days ago, father was fired from work because he was no longer of use to the company. That same day I failed an exam at uni. Because of all this, I have developed this awful constant chest pain. It hurts so much, and I barely have any energy to even lift my arms. I am constantly on the verge of tears but I can‚Äôt even cry. Just trudging through the days now. It‚Äôs awful. 

Is this normal ‚Äî well, I mean none of this is, but is it reasonable that I‚Äôm feeling this way? Does chest pain happen in moments like these?"

575,depression,My therapist said that my life circumstances aren‚Äôt enough to make me depressed,"I‚Äôll preface this with: I love my therapist. She has been amazing so far, &amp; I especially love that she doesn‚Äôt push labels or meds on me. 

However, lately I have been feeling depressed. I have quite a lot going on that, individually, worsen my mood and outlook on life. My grandma moved into a home (I traveled to see her &amp; that‚Äôs when I noticed the depressive symptoms coming on), my busy internship &amp; class schedule ended (boredom is not good for me &amp; I feel lost without my internship), my potential roommates ghosted me after I turned down their offer to live with them, traumatic memories/feelings are being brought up in my new relationship, and my dad and I got into a fight and aren‚Äôt on speaking terms. 

To me, all of this sounds like more than enough to cause situation depression. But my therapist thinks it‚Äôs my birth control, not any of this. To me, it seems obvious these circumstances could make anyone depressed, especially someone who is very sensitive like myself. It annoys me that she said that. Who is she to say that it isn‚Äôt enough? It all depends on how these things affect me, how I cope with them, how I view them. My grandma moving into a home makes me feel like my childhood is being ripped away. Her sadness makes me feel hopeless. Couldn‚Äôt that alone make someone depressed? I even told her that I was feeling ‚Äúoff‚Äù when I was traveling, before I started the pill, yet she still said it‚Äôs most likely the birth control.üôÅ"
576,depression,When would be a good time to bring up therapy to partner who has depression?,"Hi, I've been wanting to encourage my boyfriend to go to therapy. I've mentioned it once a few weeks ago, he didn't say anything back then. He's probably considering it. 

I don't know if I should bring it up again, and if I do should I say it when he's stable and calm? Is it a bad idea to talk about therapy when he's feeling depressed? Will I make him feel like I want to push him to doctors so I don't have to deal with him? How should I phrase it so he knows I'm here for him if he needs?

Any advice?"
577,depression,Psychogenic tremors as a result of depression? For how long?,"I have been experiencing psychogenic tremors possibly as a result of depression and anxiety whenever I exercise my upper body. My legs started to experience tremors when I walked down the stairs, but those are mostly gone now. I‚Äôve tried CBT and my shrink had me distract myself while doing, for example, push-ups, by singing a song or listening to music. It worked a little at first but now I‚Äôm just demoralized. Anybody with experience with psychogenic tremors and how to cure them? I‚Äôve ruled out virtually all physiological causes by visiting the hospital many times, by the way."

587,depression,Let's have a good conversation before I die.,[removed]
588,depression,Was doing well with depression but an opponent in an online game really messed me up,"I was playing a really popular online FPS (not giving it away because I want extra anonymity and it doesn't matter anyway) and I was playing pretty okay: not my best nor my worst. I got some kills in and two of them were of one player.
Later they finally got a kill on me when I approached two enemies alone. I was like ""whatever"" because I admittedly walked into that, it was 2v1, and I knew that I wasn't playing at my best that game. But then the one player proceeded to teabag me for a relative while (a solid 5 seconds). Not even their teammate joined in.
I've only been teabagged a handful of times over my collective 3 years of playing the game (mostly bc I play console) and it's only ever gotten me annoyed at most. But for some reason, this time was different.
It genuinely hurt me because I literally did not do *anything* to the player and it was so fast and aggressive, as if they really wanted to insult me. Plus, it was a sneaky kill and I didn't even see them, not necessarily something to gloat about.
After watching a replay of our match, it may have seemed like I was targeting them because only *I* ever killed then, but even then I only killed them twice (they hid from my team for most of the game). They did not do this to anyone else and if anything, they would always go to damage ME whenever they had a choice. I just felt so targeted.
I did get my revenge, but I had to go a little out of my way to do it. When I did kill them they typed (basically) ""what a good job helping your team"" Later, both our teams were attacking each other equally and they got a kill off me because of it and they teabagged me AGAIN even though I literally was not even paying attention to them nor attacking them.
Like, why so agro? They had a personal vendetta against me or something.
On the game's subreddit it seems to be split 60/40 between people who think teabagging is just a light-hearted joke/a strategy to deliberately tilt opponents or just straight-up BM respectively. So it feels like I'm being too sensitive about it and I should just shut up because ""it's just pixels and how can pixels be offensive?""
I know this is a very small incident, but it really did affect me a lot and I don't even know why. I've never been the target of a chat insult before, so I guess the criticism just freaked me out. It ruined the rest of my night. I honestly forgot my good games afterward until writing this now. I haven't gotten depressed for a little bit. Why did this have to bring it back?
Also, am I being too sensitive? How do I just let this kind of stuff go?"
589,depression,my mother has depression or dementia not sure,"In march i and my mom went to psychiatric hospital , she was having unexplained anxiety . doctors diagnosed her with anxiety with the next visits they changed it to major depressive disorder saying anxiety within her age (63) can be a symptom of depression . she is taking effexor xr 75mg and remeron 15mg since then and she started to improve a little but not too much.  
   
she recently shows some odd behaviors like forgetting events , misplacing things and she once placed her phone on cooker , repeating questions. i talked to her she denied such things. I don't know if these symptoms are part of her depression or maybe depression is related to underlying dementia i don't really know.  
I can't stop thinking about it and i haven't slept last night searching the entire web and got no answers. Thing is our next visit is in 2 weeks and we can't ask to make it earlier except if we pay expenses which we can't afford right now.

591,depression,I hate myself but strangely I have never been more confident in myself because I just don‚Äôt care anymore,I am a very self loathing person. I hate myself for a lot of reasons but it has gotten to the point where I just don‚Äôt care anymore. And this indifference to my own emotional anguish has somehow given me confidence I have never had. I am able to approach and talk to and flirt with women I am attracted to because I now have this feeling like I cannot be hurt or broken more than I already am. I know this is not a healthy way to think but at the same time I do not want to think differently because I have never had more confidence in myself. This has happened since my mom passed away from Covid in March. I no longer feel like I have anything to live for as my mother was the rock in my life and that feeling has actually been very liberating. It has been liberating in the sense that I no longer care about rejection because I have already rejected myself and my own life. I feel as though no one can hurt me because I am already a shattered and broken person and nothing matters anymore. I do not care what you think of me anymore because it doesn‚Äôt matter. I know I need help because I am very depressed but I have no health insurance and cannot afford a therapist. I now seek casual encounters with strange women because it‚Äôs really the only time I feel alive. I know I am sick but I do not know how to stop this downward spiral I am on.

595,depression,Scared of disappointing my parents,"**Long read**
18m My parents had a significantly worse upbringing than me. My dad lived in a semi-poor rural farm in Italy, and my mom lived on top of my grandmothers shop in a beach town barely getting by. When I was a toddler my dad bought a bar and worked 60-70 hours a week to pay the bills, and my mom owned a art shop also putting in a lot of work. They worked insanely hard and it paid off because when I was 5 we moved to America, a year before my little brother was born. Grew up comfortable but early experienced hardship and responsibility, and man am I regretting it now. Now, I‚Äôm a freshman in community college with a 2.5 gpa since I made the shitty mistake of falling into the party lifestyle 11-12th grade and now finally realizing I need to grow tf up. I have no idea what I want to do with my life, I‚Äôm a undecided major and I just don‚Äôt see a future in some 9-5 job. I feel like a failure because I don‚Äôt have the insane work ethic my parents had at my age. I didn‚Äôt give a fuck about anything the last two years of high school, I would go to class high and hung out with druggies who didn‚Äôt do anything but smoke weed and do drugs. I wish I could talk to my 16 year old self and tell him to stop being a lazy dumbass, because I am really regretting it now. I want to transfer to a better college and get a well paying job but my gpa is a 2.5, nothing special at all, and even though I still have another year to raise it, Im scared I‚Äôll fuck it up. I just don‚Äôt want to disappoint my parents, all this work for their son to be a failure."

I forget what happened in previous episodes so quickly. 

Ive been struggling to follow plots in movies, shows, and books lately because I can‚Äôt keep up or get engulfed in the overall universe of the story like I used to be able to do effortlessly. Even if I‚Äôm watching my favorite show for the 10th time I have to concentrate super hard to be able to absorb it enough to enjoy it. I have to manually remind myself things that I would typically remember immediately &amp; effortlessly. It‚Äôs like everything feels unfamiliar even though it‚Äôs not. 

Part of me thinks I‚Äôm overthinking, but I also feel like I can‚Äôt just turn my brain off because than I‚Äôm not focusing. This has never been an issue for me until about the last year or so. Early onset dementia?? Brain tumor?? Going insane?? Depression?? Overthinking?? Lol help me plz."

I still feel this overwhelming sense of dulled anticipation. Like i am at the starting line, and any day now, i'll begin the run which is my life, but the time is never coming to actually start, so i have just powered off, waiting for something to switch me back on again. At first i thought it would come, but now it's been so long that i dont know, im exhausted. Doesnt help i turned 18 in april 2020. Literally became an adult and left home during this shit. The world is not really restricted whatsoever anymore, but i still feel like i'm waiting for the pandemic to end. It's like every false alarm that 'covid is gone!' followed by yet another lockdown has totally broken my trust in 'normal life', i just don't believe that my sens of normalcy and stability won't be taken away again. I am also totally depersonalised, spaced out all the time. I just can't fathom how i went from who i was two years ago to who i am now. I don't have a clue of who i am, what i want, where i am going. How can I when i have spent two years avoiding everything, because i juuuust need to wait a liiiittle longer before bloody living. it's like i have this deep sense of grief for what could have been had covid never happened. It ruined friendships, a relationship, took away my first choice University, forced me into loneliness and isolation. It just ruined everything.

609,depression,Is being chronically tired a sign of being depressed?,Basically I feel like I‚Äôm exhausted every day despite getting ‚Äúenough‚Äù sleep where I shouldn‚Äôt feel this way. This has been going on for a really long time (years) and otherwise I‚Äôm physically healthy so I‚Äôm starting to wonder if this is tied to how emotionally I‚Äôm not always in a great place. I have good days and bad days but the tiredness never goes away no matter how good I feel.
610,depression,I am Fully Convinced The Universe has Decided I Don‚Äôt Belong Here,"For Context I have had Clinical Depression for about Three Years now. Ive taken various different medications and although they take the edge off, Ive never felt true happiness for an extended period of time. I generally suffer from mood swings between anger, depression, and feeling content. I‚Äôm pretty sure I have Borderline Personality Disorder or Psychopathy because I fit every textbook requirement, but whenever I bring it up to a psychiatrist, they just tell me to switch antidepressants. So, I take the pills and go about with my life, still managing to get A‚Äôs in school and keep myself alive out of a sheer basic discipline somewhere inside me. But it‚Äôs all painfully hard. I have no motivation for anything, I have trouble going to sleep, and I never feel good about anything that I do. All I feel every moment of every day is either crushing anxiety or complete self loathing and worthlessness.

What truly brings me down is that outside of the present moment I am in, I feel like I don‚Äôt even exist. I have a lot of friends that I am close with, and have an active social media presence, and yet not a single person besides my parents wished me happy birthday when I turned 19 a few weeks ago. Even in the world of everybody posting birthday wishes on instagram stories all the time, I was forgotten by all the people I know. Things only get even more upsetting to me when I take into consideration that my close friends are all thriving for the most part. Even though one broke up with his girlfriend who didn‚Äôt want to talk to him, he found a better girl the next day and they are happily together. Every one of my close friends is in a long term relationship. Ive never even been on a single date in my entire life. We‚Äôre all kinda nerds, but I am by far the most charismatic and conventionally attractive member of that friend group, but it‚Äôs like there is just something in the way that makes it so that people never ask me out, and the people I find attractive are never anywhere to be seen. Ive been on dating apps for months now, and I haven‚Äôt even gotten a single match.

The real icing on the cake is that I am an actor who is really going through it right now. I am at a prestigious theatre program at an LA university, and after an entire year have not been cast in a single thing despite watching the other auditioners who I believe have objectively less talent land the roles. I don‚Äôt want to hear the response of ‚Äúacting is a hard business, most people don‚Äôt make it‚Äù. I‚Äôm well aware of that but I‚Äôm doing it because I need to and fully believe I have what it takes to be a massive success. There is no other option for me, because I know that if not for acting, I most certainly wouldn‚Äôt be here to tell this story. Ive gotten to points that low several times, but I never actually have a desire to end my own life, because then I can‚Äôt prove myself. All I can do is simply wish I were dead every moment of every day.

All in all, with nobody to love and no roles coming my way, I really feel like it‚Äôs just a matter of me being a mistake. I don‚Äôt even feel real anymore. I‚Äôm just a husk going moment to moment doing what I need to do knowing that Im going down a path to failure."

I tried healthy diet, excercising, hobbies, learning new things, journaling and a ton of different things. I have a job, graduated from college, I‚Äôve been in a wonderful relationship for 8 years now. Still stuck with severe depression, got diagnosed with anxiety&amp;depressive personality disorder.

I thought I had ADD in the past but I dont think I have ADD because I can‚Äôt concentrate in studies only. I can concentrate on other things perfectly. 

Will taking anti-depressant or anti-anxiety medication help me to concentrate. Please Help. I am really frustrated because my exams are coming and all I do is day dream and can‚Äôt concentrate at all :("

617,depression,Memory Loss,Was diagnosed with severe clinical depression a couple of years ago. Since then I‚Äôve gotten better and worse. I‚Äôve been on and anti depressants several times. One thing that I lost with depression was my short term memory. I‚Äôm better now but it never came back. Has anyone else had this?

619,depression,"I just don't know where to start, looking for help on this...","Basically the title says it all. I'm constantly drinking to get through the day, and I can barely get out of bed. I'm gainfully employed at least, I have an amazing wife and child but I've been self medicating with alcohol for damn near two years.
 
Luckily for me, I am 100% remote with my job. When I was going into the office cocaine was abundant so I was doing it almost every day, all day.  Being remote has helped in that respect at least, but now I'm just constantly miserable and can't stop drinking to get through the day.
 
I guess the main thing my brain keeps fucking with me about is this feeling of existential dread. I'm constantly scared about what the future might hold, and in particular I constantly stress about what my child will have to deal with in the future.
 
I feel extremely stupid for living this way, something is wrong with my brain. We are totally fine financially and I'm pretty sure my daughter will never want for anything. I just can't seem to find any reason to go on, and I know this isn't right. 
 
I am, at least for now, still a functioning alcoholic. I don't lash out or cause too much grief for my family and friends. That said I just can't continue on this path and I don't really know where to go to get some help.
 
I tried a therapist last year but they ended up matching me with a young woman who really couldn't relate with (I'm an older guy, pushing 50). So yeah, I ended up ghosting that therapist and haven't sought any help since then.
 
I dunno, I'm just tired all the time and I know none of this is rational. I was just hoping maybe someone on this sub could relate and help steer me towards a solution. Should I find a psychiatrist and try to get medicated?  I'm sure therapy could also help, but I also think I might need some kind of medication to help with this constant gloom.

That's all I've got. I just really want to be more in the moment and more present with my family but I'm struggling every damn day. Any suggestions are welcome, thanks for reading."
620,depression,My current teen depression(I'm currently 14),"I'm posint this because I feel like this is a topic that should be talked about more and its about teen depression, I'm not talking about emos or junk like that I'm talking about near death experiences that happened because of the person themselves, from hanging to just laying there in the road. I almost killed myself today because I feel like I'm not worth any attention, the bruises on my arm, my fingers getting twisted every lunch. Theres only so much someone can take, everyone has thier limits and I'm pushing mine. The only reason I didnt was because, well actually I don't know maybe I don't have the guts to do it or maybe there's nothing stopping me and I'm just scared about what comes after."
621,depression,Important Information about Anhedonia / Low Hedonic Tone (Core Symptom of Clinical Depression),"""Anhedonia, defined as the state of reduced ability to experience feelings of pleasure, is one of the hallmarks of depression. However, the term anhedonia is insufficient to summarize the intricate and multidimensional reward-associated deficits displayed by patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Deficits in reward-related processing may present as loss of interest or pleasure and may impede an individual‚Äôs ability to engage in goal-directed behavior. These behaviors may include the lack of anticipation or prediction of expected rewards, lack of ability to evaluate the perceived values and costs associated with anticipated rewards, inability to gauge the amount of effort required to attain rewards, inability to evaluate whether the effort is sufficiently rewarded, and lack of motivation to execute actions required to attain rewards."" 

""If anhedonia is the state of reduced ability to feel pleasure, then hedonic tone, also referred to as hedonic capacity or hedonic responsiveness, is the trait or genetic predisposition underlying one‚Äôs baseline range and lifelong characteristic ability to feel pleasure. Low hedonic tone represents a reduced capacity to experience pleasure at any given time, thus increasing the likelihood of experiencing anhedonia.[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b6-ndt-12-2149),[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b7-ndt-12-2149)""

""Low hedonic tone has been associated with several psychopathologies, including major depressive disorder (MDD), substance use, and schizophrenia,[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b8-ndt-12-2149),[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b9-ndt-12-2149) although variations in hedonic tone can also be observed in healthy individuals.[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b10-ndt-12-2149)""

""It can be hypothesized that individuals suffering with genetically lower set point, or lower hedonic tone, will need to do more to feel neutral or euthymic, resulting in an increased need for stimulation.[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b11-ndt-12-2149) In part, this may manifest as seeking external stimulation (eg, dangerous or risky behavior and substance abuse) or internal stimulation (eg, fantasy) that will raise their hedonic tone.[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b12-ndt-12-2149) Regardless of the choice to externally or internally raise their hedonic tone, patients with this trait would consistently attempt to cope by finding ways to maximize pleasure and raise mood from their low baseline tone. Furthermore, when stimulation is absent, individuals with low hedonic tone would be hypothesized to experience a shift toward that individual‚Äôs more usual lower hedonic tone and therefore suffer a drop in their mood to their more common baseline dysphoric state ([Figure 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/figure/f1-ndt-12-2149/)).[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b12-ndt-12-2149)""

""Thus, it is not surprising that a large body of evidence points to the involvement of the reward system, particularly the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, in mediating the degree of anhedonia at any given time[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b6-ndt-12-2149),[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b7-ndt-12-2149) as well as the risk of developing dysthymia and depression.[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b13-ndt-12-2149),[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b14-ndt-12-2149) Recent research into the neurobiology of anhedonia has focused on neurobiology of reward and motivation and has identified associated dopaminergic circuits as playing a key role in the maintenance of hedonic tone,[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b2-ndt-12-2149),[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b4-ndt-12-2149),[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b15-ndt-12-2149),[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b16-ndt-12-2149) specifically neural circuits that contain bottom-up and top-down projections into the prefrontal cortex (PFC), lateral habenula, and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) system.[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b17-ndt-12-2149) In association, specific deficits in a variety of PFC areas have been implicated in anhedonia ([Figure 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/figure/f2-ndt-12-2149/)).[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b5-ndt-12-2149) ""

622,depression,Late Night Sadness,"So I‚Äôm currently sitting here crying because I‚Äôm realizing that I‚Äôm hurt. 
My life story is pretty long so I‚Äôll just say what matters: my father left me when i was a kid. 
Years later, he tried to reconnect with me and that little girl inside of me was so excited. 
I finally get to know who my father really is.
When we met up things went well. Everything seemed great but then one day, he ghosted me. Again. 
Now before you ask me if i tried calling or texting him, why should I? 
This man has done this to me before so I‚Äôm stupid to think he wouldn‚Äôt again.
He‚Äôs married and has two kids that he takes very much good care of. 
I don‚Äôt even exist to him and it hurts. It hurts so bad and I‚Äôm tired of holding it in. 

I feel like i can‚Äôt speak to my mom about it because she has her father in her life. My cousins have their father in their life. My grandma had hers in her life until he passed. So it‚Äôs like nobody understands this pain. 
Plus, i don‚Äôt want my mom to feel like she did something wrong. 

I just wanted my dad to be in my life to maybe heal the parts of me that i needed to heal with him being gone for so many years .. and he lied to me and told me he was never gonna leave me again .. and he did that to me. 

All this is coming up because my birthday just passed and my dad was around last year (when we were supposedly building our relationship) and he was there for me to sing me happy birthday. Brought me cake and everything. It was everything i wish i had from him years ago for my other birthdays. 

Now he‚Äôs not going to walk me down the aisle , see me graduate college or meet my daughter like i was so hopeful for..

It‚Äôs breaking my heart. I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to. I didn‚Äôt want to try to sleep with this on my chest.. but honestly idk. I just want to crawl into bed and never come out. 

I just want to disappear. How could the man who helped make me, not want anything to do with me?

It makes me realize that maybe no man will ever love me. Maybe they all will leave.. And that hurts. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me..i wish things could‚Äôve been different..

Im not able to sleep and i can‚Äôt stop crying."
623,depression,I mean nothing,"I'm a 17 yr old guy who has almost always had something to cause depression. Usually the causes sort themselves out or Ill realize that there was no reason to worry about it, but this one feels different because it isn't about an immediate problem. For the first two years of high school I was a really nervous person, scared of social encounters and really just a loser. My sophomore year I got kicked out of my friend group and it caused me to reevaluate who I was and I regained all the confidence I had lost before high school and now I'm a really popular person in my grade. But because for the first two years I was so awkward, I didn't join any extracurriculars or engage in any school related groups because I was too scared, and now it seems like it's too late to start. This causes me to feel like I'm severely behind everybody else, even if some people who are engaged with these groups are considered wildly less popular than me. I'm scared to start now as well because I feel like if i failed at whatever i tried i wouldn't be able to live it down for a really long time. I'm a really smart person, i've got perfect scores in some categories on the ACT and my overall score is paid scholarship level, but I'm worried because of my lack of extracurriculars colleges won't care about me and I'll have peaked in high school without having even done anything notable. I also feel like out of 8 billion people I'll be just another drop in the bucket, like I won't ever do anything good or achieve anything because what would be the point when there's billions of other people who could do the same thing. I have no idea how to stop feeling like this and it doesn't feel like it will end. What should i do? i hate feeling like this but i don't know how to explain it to anybody in my life who could help."
624,depression,Wish I could go back to years ago and do things differently,"If I could just go back to when I was living with my parents and call cps because of their abuse, finish school in a healthy environment, start learning to be patient with myself and accept and love myself earlier, start working on my social skills earlier, I would do it."
625,depression,I wish I didn't wake up today,"Great... It's morning again and I am sad that i woke up. I'm so tired of everything. Going there every single day, day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year.. A whole life based on misery, regrets, loneliness, shame, guilt, frustration, stress, being unlovable.. A life of traumas, a life of looking at your horrific past and hoping to go back to the constant bullying just because today it's much worse than just being bullied."
626,depression,Please try to save my life.,"



I can‚Äôt remember what my life was like before depression. All I can remember is this feeling. An emotionless, stuttering, insecure, anxious white knuckled 22 year old that is just getting by, barely, hour by hour. Day by day. It‚Äôs like survival mode. All I am focused on is getting through the day in one piece. Everyday is a test. There are 1000 ways to fail, or not live up to someone else‚Äôs standards. Failing is the only guarantee. I am starting to push away those that I love and those that care about me since I am unable to show my true emotions anymore. Nobody wants to put up with me. They are frustrate because I am withdrawn. Friends are slowly disappearing from my life, and slowly my family is too. I am nothing but a shell with nothing living inside. I see people laying on the floor crying of laughter, and Im over here trying to remember the last time I laughed. I have lost every bit of me that made me me. That made me happy. It‚Äôs all gone, and it‚Äôs not coming back anytime soon. If there really was someone out there watching, listening, and caring then I would have been rescued by now. Everyday I stare at a box cutter knife on my bedside, visualizing thrusting that knife and penetrating into my chest, into my heart, ending my suffering in seconds. At this point after all the medicines I‚Äôve tried, all the therapy I‚Äôve tried, all the dieting I‚Äôve tried, all the exercise  I‚Äôve tried, I have come to the conclusion that this is just how it‚Äôs gonna be. My insanely mentally ill brain. It‚Äôs like having a life sentence in prison. One day I will go through with the box cutter idealization .Once there is nothing left for me to say, nobody left for me to count on, and nothing to hold me back. Until then I will keep dragging myself  through these days until the timer runs out, and I can finally say I have had enough of this cold, cold world."

632,depression,Feeling Lost F/24,"Hello. I don‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to so here I am. To start off, I live with my mom and have never lived on my own. My brother who is in his 40s recently got out of a long relationship, got kicked out, and is now living with my mom and I on a mattress in the living room. He is an alcoholic and has had 2 seizures since living with us (about 2 years). I think he‚Äôs doing better now but it‚Äôs unclear if he‚Äôs still drinking or not since he‚Äôs so sneaky with it. Anyway, he doesn‚Äôt have a job nor cares to look for one. He sits there and plays video games all day and doesn‚Äôt have any concern for his life. He somehow gets poop on the toilet seat every time he uses it and I have to clean it every time. He doesn‚Äôt clean or do the dishes. 

I have been struggling to keep a job because I don‚Äôt have any motivation. When I get up in the morning all I see is my brother being a low life on the couch and it makes me not want to do anything. I recently got a job as a medical assistant but after two days I‚Äôm over it and realize I don‚Äôt want this career (I‚Äôve held a job as an MA in the past but giving it a second chance now). So tomorrow I already have an interview lined up with a restaurant job. So basically, when I don‚Äôt have a job I feel like a loser and get stressed about how I‚Äôm going to pay my bills and when I do have a job I think ‚Äúwhat the hell am I doing with my life?‚Äù because I‚Äôm the only one working in my household and have to deal with my stinky brother every day. Not to mention my boyfriend and I are taking a break because we don‚Äôt agree on things and that‚Äôs been hard on me. I feel like a lot of people my age have cool jobs and are making a lot of money and live on their own, but I on the other hand am stuck and I don‚Äôt know where to work, I don‚Äôt have the motivation to work, and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm ever going to get out on my own let alone know what my passion is. All of this has caused me to question my existence. So I guess I‚Äôm just searching for a little motivation on this platform. Thanks"

642,depression,a glass dome,"Depression is a glass dome. You are sitting in it. There's no way out. The oxygen is limited. You can breathe, but barely. You looked out. All 360 degrees you see. There's nothing in the way of your sight. And you stare at everything that is happening around you.¬†

You see your family. You see your friends. They are going about their lives.

You witnessed your best friend's wedding. You smiled and you felt the joy that everyone was experiencing together.¬†

You then watched another friend give birth. Oh! so cute, that little girl. or that little boy. That small little family looks so perfect and...whole.¬†

You look at yourself. In the glass dome. You smile. It's alright. You have everything you need and want for now. A happy marriage. Your own home.¬†

You watched as your friend's little one grow up. ""Aunty! look at me!"", the little one shouted from outside. You waved, you smiled.¬†

Then you heard a loud knock. Your best friend, your cousin, your friends. They all knocked on the glass dome and said ""look you! over here!"" They stand with their families. Their careers. Their travels. Their awards. Their recognitions.¬†

They waved and they started looking smaller and smaller. It's as though they were on a travellator, moving away at a constant pace. They became smaller and smaller. Their backs facing you, only with some heads turned, stretching their necks hard and far, so that they can catch the last glimpse of you.

And then you breathed. and realised that the air is limited. You looked out the glass dome. It is dark and empty. You tried to break out so that you can run after them. You hit the glass, you screamed, you threw things against it. And it cracked. but it did not break.¬†

You fell back onto the ground. You kept calling out for them. But it continued to stay dark...and quiet.¬†

And then, you are alone."
643,depression,Just a rant,"Can't sleep. Life's keeping me up. Basically, everyone throughout my life has been calling me a faggot. I had selective mutism in highschool. I couldn't talk.

I didn't get to have fun in life. Life's come to a dead end. University won't get me employed. My neighbour, I still remember, said ""fuck you"" ""loner ass bitch"" and tried shooting me.

644,depression,I live and have lived such a pathetic and sad life,"I have no one to talk to, no where to go about this so I‚Äôll dump this on you guys, hopefully that‚Äôs okay.

I try to live a good and fun life, and I have in the past but nothing is really fun anymore, and the fun I can have is pathetic and I‚Äôm lying to myself thinking I‚Äôm having a good time anymore. I just really miss my childhood, childhood friends and even highschool a little bit.

Highschool was the worst for me, I just graduated last year and as much as I‚Äôm truly glad to be out into the true world I regret a lot about it. Being surrounded by people and being antisocial, smoking my brains out making me even more stupid then I was before, only having 1 close friend those 3 years. I had all this opportunity and I wasted it. During high-school, after I graduated and now I barely had any true fun, I hate how I enjoy myself now and with other now, it‚Äôs just boring and a waste of time to me 

I moved 4 months ago across the country to start my career I‚Äôve wanted sense I was 11 and as much as that makes me happy, I don‚Äôt have time to do anything. Everything has been stacked against me for what feels like a long time but lately it seems like I can‚Äôt catch a single break, not 1 thing that goes in my way so I can get 1 less thing off my brain. Oh these 10 things are in your way of accomplishing something that you have no control over? well we have a few more to add. That or one of those 10 things gets worst and worst, it‚Äôs unbelievable how stressful shit keeps getting.

That‚Äôs all I need is 1 little thing to take some weight off my shoulders, idk we‚Äôll see how it goes hopefully something positive will happen eventually and I can use that to calm my head down.

Oh and a little thing, this job and especially my living situation is strictly no smoking or drinking. No smoking doesn‚Äôt bother me, but not being able to sit back and have a drink once a month is excessive IMO. I understand people binge drinking or drinking all the time and that being a problem, but I just want a drink to relax, take a load off and not have my sober mind to overthink everything. Especially after working my ass off these past 4 months and feeling like I‚Äôm getting no where. Is what it is

646,depression,Looking back on Past Experience,"I was a victim of Depression as-well, let me tell you something about it. It wasn‚Äôt a quick chilly Rain, No, It was a long hard winter that set off before I got a phone. It started the moment my parents undressed me naked and threw me out our apartment room for people to see. And why? Because I didn‚Äôt give the teacher my Homework. Although I didn‚Äôt understand then, But it sowed the seeds. You see, I would‚Äôve actually killed myself if I didn‚Äôt have Social Media, In it I found friends, People who cared. People who every time I even mentioned self harm would talk me off the Ledge and then tell me that I *Mattered*. I‚Äôm grateful for those people. And on the other Hand, I went to see this piece of shit Therapist at a Hospital who devalued my feelings, didn't bother to listen to me, Mostly talked to my parents without me in the room (I AM THE PATIENT!) and was a general asshole. He was like ‚ÄòThere have been 100s of people in that chair before you, So I know better and shut up‚Äô.  I still have some problems with it today but I‚Äôm proud of myself and thank Social Media. Sure, It can be destructive but Great aswell.

My parents still act like it didn‚Äôt matter.


Also, Asshole therapist should loose his license."
647,depression,Pain and sadness are the only things that feel real,"Sometimes I want to live without it, but even if I magically could cure my depression I would feel fake. This is who I am. I can run and I can hide as much as I want, I can fuck myself up with drugs as much as I want, but I can't escape the fact that I'll always be this depressed fucking mess of a human.

649,depression,I don't know how the fuck I'm gonna survive the next few months,"So I'm currently in the process of redefining my relationship, I probably won't be able to find the strength to actually leave, but I'm not going to go without sex anymore. Probably more worryingly, we've become co-dependent, so we are staying together and have been staying together even when the relationship isn't working.

Ironically, as of the past few days I don't even want to fuck anymore, just as the opportunity is finally arising. So I've ruined my fucking relationship for no reason, great. That will probably change in a few days knowing me but who knows. 

I might just not be able to even think of sex without all of these fucking feelings coming back up, it's already happened to the point where I don't even really enjoy jerking off or porn anymore because of all of the negative feelings it conjures up.

My university counselor cancelled (I don't even fucking go to classes anymore beyond just doing the assignments) and it's in like 2 weeks, and I am going to see an actual psychologist (btw, what is the difference between psychologist and therapist?)  as well, but the wait list is probably going to be months. I seriously don't know how I'm going to deal with the stress of everything, no matter the outcome."
650,depression,It disturbs me that I can't be sane if I don't have a purpose,"That's all.  I give up.  All I want is to be content.  Monkey on my back, always.  Weight.. emotional stuff, damaging.. Now I'm a wasteland of possibilities ashed out washed up chunks of dead and dying oh yeah ..."
651,depression,How do people get up everyday knowing it's all pointless?,"I've recently adhered to the idea that nothing really matters since at the end of the day eventually the world will just stop existing. All the stuff we struggle for and worry about is small. I know we're supposed to make the best of it and enjoy what we have but I have nothing to really live for.

I wake up lie in bed for a few hours, go to work, come home shower, brush my teeth, find something to do for a while then get some sleep. Wake up and repeat. The only things I enjoy are eating and jerking off. I just kind of exist at this point.

I hate this shit so much."

653,depression,Third time's the charm.,I failed to kill myself twice. And I hope that this time it works!
654,depression,INEXPLICABLE,"The birds have travelled far and long
To hear me craft a perfect tune.
But a woman dressed in repulse and sly
Whispers me an insidious lullaby.
She paralysed me,made my vocals slurry.
And I collapsed, striking a single note
That echoed a monochrome so prosaic.
She lured in a entire town's fleas
Besides threatening my timid heart, wrapped in oblivion
And my whimsical black and white keys.

She sat and ripped out my senses
 Like petals of a rose
My clarity,my awareness,my sense of judgement and gratitude,everything froze.
She made me wear a blindfold 
That sat there on my skin till it infused,
Draping my vision and shutting the world out,
Leaving everything blurried and confused.
The sickness fed on my flesh and I craved to feel my face,
No prayer,no drug,no shrink could help me scrub it off my head.
Inch by inch,the poison had branched into my core that ached.

She tricked me into a room that smelled of rot and deceit.
The walls engulfed in chaotic grey mold
Enclosed each day by a feet.
The void of darkness and numb 
Was occassionally meddled with pain and sorrow.
Sometimes,like a saw slowly grinding back and forth on my body.
And on other times,like a sudden slash of an axe on my brain
Cracking it open and leaving me to drain.

My legs got rooted in the cold dead floor
And the spiteful air choked me.
I desperately hunted for a door.
I resorted to every possible distraction
I glued my useless eyes to a tiny neon screen 
And shoved my mouth with food I couldn't taste.
Please let me out of this disdain
To breathe again,think again,live again.

Finally I see your face,at the end of the tunnel.
But you ask me, 'Is it that unbearable?
You're just being weak and superficial.'
I collapse again with just a wonder 
Which part of this whole drama is hell.
My suffering? Or my inability to express it
To people I love the most?
Who point me at the culprit,as 'her'.
Who accuse me of an imaginary crime.
I realise I need to pay my cost 
Forming apologies to your countless blames
And garnishing explainations to your plates of gossips 
Throwing away my time to heal in flames.

It's a slippery slope
And I'm back at her feet
In the pit of depression and lifelessness
Where a million trains of thoughts crash against each other
Oh! What a massacre to watch!

It's a gigantic loop.
And I'm sick and tired 
Of being sick and tired.
I'd do anything to get out of it.
Yet I can't do anything to get out of it.

655,depression,I can‚Äôt take this anymore,It hurts way too much. I want to bash my head on a wall till I bleed. I want to cut my arms or legs. I don‚Äôt want to feel like this anymore. I hate this. But I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt let my parents down like this. But that makes me feel even worse. They‚Äôre so kind and caring. I feel like shit. I want to give up. I feel so hopeless It makes me sick. I feel so empty I can‚Äôt even focus in school. I haven‚Äôt even done work in weeks. The antidepressants don‚Äôt work anymore. So what‚Äôs the point
656,depression,My psychiatrist slept with me then discarded me like trash. What shall I do?!,"I‚Äôve been seeing this psychiatrist for months before she decided to ruin everything just to satisfy her needs.  It was my first ever psychiatrist and I was seeing her for my sever depression, anxiety, and PTSD.  She‚Äôs about 10 years older than I am with over 25 years of experience in this field. To be fair, initially i was benefiting from the sessions and things were heading in the right direction.  During all this, she was going through a divorce and her mind was all over the place.  Long story short, after a few months of seeing her, somehow I had a feeling that she‚Äôs into me but I ignored it because my mental health was my priority and the last thing I wanted was to cause myself even more harm by ruining my relationship with my doctor.  After months of trying to convince me to go out with her for a drink (her excuse was to observe how I behave in social settings) I agreed and went for it.  We both got a little tipsy and then she asked me if I wanted to have sex with her.  I agreed to it after a while and we booked a room and had sex a few times.  After that night she started telling me that she loves me and wanted to hang out again the following night to have sex.  I was hesitant at first but then went ahead with it.  I know I should‚Äôve put a stop to it immediately but being very vulnerable and in such a messed up state of mind I wasn‚Äôt thinking and done what she wanted me to do.  She kept repeating the words ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok you can trust me‚Äù the whole time but deep down I knew it was wrong.  After that night, I had an appointment with her a couple of days later and I decided to tell her how I felt and whatever is going on has to stop because I didn‚Äôt want to ruin the doctor-patient relationship with her and my mental health is my priority and it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hear for.  She could tell how much it was bothering me and the amount of anxiety it was causing but she didn‚Äôt care and kept on trying.  I kept trying to explain to her that it is wrong and it‚Äôs affecting my progress but she didn‚Äôt cate about how I felt whatsoever.  Eventually she got the point and stopped but it came at a cost.  She didn‚Äôt care anymore about my mental health and her personality just changed towards me.  Basically, she neglected me and started treating me like trash.  It reached the point where I would text her that I‚Äôm suicidal and her reply would be ‚Äúoh boy‚Äù and just ignore me.  Eventually i decided to leave her and look for another psychiatrist.  After this experience, I have a lot of resentment towards her and I‚Äôm consumed with anger because of her unprofessionalism and what she put me through.  I‚Äôm also angry about the fact that she knew how severe my mental illness was but she still put her needs first and actually today my condition is worse because of her.  Just FYI, I spent over USD 10k on treatment with her and this is what I got from supposedly the best psychiatrist in my country.  Today, my hatred towards her is extreme and a part of me can‚Äôt let go of the shit she put me through.  What shall I do?!"
657,depression,Can‚Äôt seem to get my life together despite having help with therapy and medication. More in body. Any insight will be helpful.,"Every time I pull myself out of my depression hole and start working on myself, something happens like a fight with SO and I regress instantly.

To elaborate, I‚Äôve been in therapy and on meds which seem to help. My therapist is amazing and we have made lots of progress. I feel empowered after a session and have the desire to get my shit together but then some shit goes down irl and I regress into a dysfunctional ball of mass, incapable of doing anything. 


I cry too much, I stay in bed and my heat rate shoots up. I feel like my inability to handle a roadblock or a setback keeps in the depression loop. 

Does anyone have any insight to offer.

I‚Äôm on Quetiapine and sertraline and doing mentalisation based therapy after having done DBT in past. 

I am a smart person otherwise, with a masters in engineering and I feel like I‚Äôm wasting all my potential away. I oscillate between berating myself and pitying. 

Anyone in the same boat?"

This is prob the last thing i ever write lol"
662,depression,"I give up, i can't trust anyone","I've no trust in my family to talk to them about anything, I have one friend who basically only talks to me because we work together, and basically all other friends are and have been online.

I can't trust them, everyone I talk to just ghosts me 74 people in the last two years, like 9 in the last few months.

No matter how genuine I am, no matter how hard I try to be different, or change, they just stop responding randomly, slowly taking longer and longer, short responses...eventually people just leave, no matter how long we talk 

It doesn't matter what they say anymore, I've heard every promise, every ""I wouldn't do that"" variation, every ""I like talking to you"", 

Nothing but lies baiting me to make me feel good or something.

I'm tired, I'm so afraid of going back to the absolute silence of having literally zero people to go to, for anything...but at this point I literally just don't believe people or trust anyone about anything they say about me or our relationship.

I know nobody cares, nobody read this, and I'm just talking to myself...but it's not like I have anyone else.

I'm done, from now on I will just isolate myself again, no more believing people."
663,depression,Not sure how it gets better,This is my first time posting. I just don‚Äôt know how things will ever feel better in my life. I‚Äôm 26 and I hate myself. I cringe at everything I say and do. Any time I recall something embarrassing or painful I verbally say some variation of ‚ÄúI wish I was dead‚Äù. It‚Äôs literally become a reflex at this point. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve accomplished anything and all I ever do is think about how great my life could have been if I had done it differently. I don‚Äôt want to die I just want a do-over. Every social situation makes me feel anxious. I stay home as often as I can. I don‚Äôt have any friends. Any friends that I did have dumped me years ago and never looked back. I don‚Äôt know if anyone outside my family has ever really cared about me. How am I supposed to like myself when no one else does? Doesn‚Äôt that make me a bad person? I just don‚Äôt see a way for this pain to ever go away. I have great parents who gave me a great life and so many other privileges. Do I even deserve to feel this way? Or am I just making excuses for being a lesser person?
664,depression,Why are relationships so tiring?,"Like, don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs amazing to have someone there for you, either a good friend, partner, family member, etc. Having any kind of good relationship with someone is amazing. 

But it‚Äôs also so tiresome, like it‚Äôs weighing me down. Having someone to care for you and there for you and all that good shit relationships bring with them, it‚Äôs just too much and too tiring.

Does someone feel like this? Or does someone know anything about this?"

668,depression,"""the deep red of the deserving""","Trigger warning: self harm 

This is a journal entry I found today. Must've been 16 years old when I wrote this. I still struggle with my depression and anxiety, but the self harm is at bay for now. This entry took me back to that time and I honestly just thought it was interesting and thought you might too. Buckle down if you want, she's lengthy 

""It does not end. It is a column of negative thoughts. A list of bullet points that stretches it's limbs for a thousand miles, and though unseen, never unheard. 

Far from unheard, the list repeats, each time adding a new point. With every repetition, the weight becomes heavier, the shadow grasping at my throat becomes tighter, and within my stomach, I feel something new begin to fester. As each second passes, it's as if a quarter is being dropped into the pit of my stomach. The weight adds until minutes later, its as if there's hundreds of quarters resting themselves inside of my stomach. All that im able to do is heave, waiting for something to come up, but it's never a feeling of release. 

While the weight lie atop my chest, while the shadow grips my throat, while the quarters multiply, I am blind. My vision impaired, blurred from the overflow of liquid spilling over in a myriad of weight, what feels like gallons fill my eyes. The salty taste of my tears reaching the corners of my lips, demanding entrance. I am blind. The dim light shines through, but I am blind. 

I rub at my eyes endlessly, but the tears only come back. They reappear in multiples, and so I sit. All of the symptoms adding on top of eachother with no remedy in sight. I sit with my face flat on my bed, eyes still open. I sit contemplating, as I finally see a remedy. 

The scars on my wrist, they speak for themselves. They tell a story of a girl with nowhere to go. No 'up' to jump to, no 'down' to fall. A girl who only sees one option. To place a blade upon her bare skin, and pull. To watch as her skin splits apart, watch as the blade tints in color, watch as the blood pools in the divot she's created. The deep red of the deserving."""
669,depression,Trapped,"I've been depressed many times in my life but not to this extent right now. I'm newly prescribed citalopram and 3 weeks in so maybe that has something to do with my current mindset. I live in at my place of work which is in the middle of nowhere, approximately 40 mins to nearest town which is the 1st thing that makes me feel trapped. Secondly I don't have my own transportation at the moment. Third I'm struggling to find anything in common with my colleagues and the fourth thing making me feel trapped is I don't have enough money to move away or get my own place (I share the accomodation). I know these things can change with time but it's an overwhelming feeling that spirals out of control. Anybody in a similar situation that managed to overcome the feeling of utter dread? TIA"

I‚Äôm just so tired of everything, of people, of relationships, of life, of everything.

But at the same time I know it‚Äôs selfish, I know there are people who care about me and I care about them too, and it would be selfish to just disappear from the radar for some time or forever. But they‚Äôd get over it eventually, I‚Äôm not someone that is worth crying over, I‚Äôm forgettable.

672,depression,Overdosing doesn't end well,"I'm not sure what was going through my mind but yesterday night I ended up taking all the paracetamol i had (12-13 approx.) I honestly just just didn't want to wake up anymore. I wanted a break from everything, temporary or permanent. But I woke up and was feeling really nauseous. I ended up puking some 20 times in total. The doctor asked what did u eat and stuff but it didn't make sense as to why I was puking so much. I couldn't tell them that I tried to overdose myself coz if they knew, my mom would also come to know and it might hurt her a lot. And I might end up in a mental hospital. Honestly, I don't mind going to mental hospital, atleast I'll get a break from everything for while, as long as my mom wouldn't know about it. I love my mom but I just can't anymore."
673,depression,I feel no interest in living,"Even when I feel ""okay"" I could still say I have no interest. I could be doing the most fun thing in the world and I still would rather not exist at all. I've been struggling with severe depression and anxiety for the last 6 years, since I was 13. I had a wonderful childhood and I don't have any horrible trauma, but I was still cursed with this horrible disease. Im assuming it's genetic because I have to rely on medicine just to feel somewhat normal. I have so much trouble handling my emotions, they are the bane of my existence and the most troublesome thing I have in my life. I'm constsntly irritable and on edge all of the time, I don't remember a moment in the last few years where I wasn't. I'm 3 weeks away from graduating highschool and I haven't been able to get up and go to school for the past 2 or 3 weeks. I just want to lay in bed and live out my ""fantasy"" of not existing. Sleeping is the closest I can get to that without actually taking my life. I don't feel like I belong here at all. Maybe somewhere else but Idk exactly where. I'm starting to convince myself that maybe Im not meant to be here after all. Sometimes I wish I could give my life to someone who's terminally ill and has the desire to live that I don't have.

I'm afraid to wake up one day in the hospital after a suicide attempt, there are times when the motivation doesn't allow me to do it, and others when it seems like my body is acting on its own. I want to go to the hospital but it won't do any good. They will tell me to go to a psychiatrist, but I don't trust anyone, I'm convinced that deep down I'm worthless and awful. I can't change this belief. When I was on medication, I didn't take it either. I want to continue to isolate myself but that's not a solution either. 

It hurts me to go to school and see people, I feel like an animal, a dog or a deer. Despite all this, I would have thought that I wouldn't feel the pressure to get better and that I would get used to it, but no. I'm skipping whole weeks of classes and I have a math test this afternoon and I don't know what it is about, I feel so many things now : anger, fear, sadness, stress, pain and shame.

I'm so lazy that I don't work on the things that are causing my problems. I just avoid everything. All I want to do is get away from the things that cause my issues and I can't, so my depression is getting worse.

I wish I wasn't born. I never asked to be born and now I have to live with envy of others who are having great lives and experiences.

I don't relate to anyone where I live, they all want babies and families, a mortgage and 2 cars, the most boring mediocrity that anyone can subject themselves to.

I'm sick of doing normal shit and finding life boring. I have things that I do (horse riding and weightlifting) that should bring me joy but I'm either forcing myself to do them or having only short lived joy that never lasts.

I wish I could be somewhere else but this would mean I have to work on my problems and I just *cannot be bothered*.

685,depression,rant ig?? if anyone has advice pls give me anything,"so i dont even know where to start, I am 16 and i am also a trans guy, ive been only diagnosed with adhd, anxiety, and depression i think. i used to be in therapy and stuff but it never worked out for me.
im not sure but i think i have been pretty much traumatized in a way over the things ive been through over the past 5ish years or so. i guess i struggle with addiction in a way, i love getting fucked up (havent been as much lately because of severe depression), but anyways i am a heavy weed smoker and im also addicted to nicotine. this probably all started when i was 11-12. i always hung out with older kids and they all did drugs so it got me into alot of really bad shit when i was so young. i mean i am still young, shit. but anyways  yea that led to me having a pill problem for a little while and taking acid way too much for someone whos brain isnt fully developed. 
I was also sexually active pretty young too, and i regret it every single day. i wont go into that as much cus nobody wants to hear about that shit, but i think you get the point. i got myself into some shit a couple times that i am still regretting to this day. 
ive always been poor, so ive gotten really desperate at times for anything i couldnt afford that time, whether be stealing or anything like that. plus i guess i never noticed that i didn‚Äôt exactly have the best childhood when i was little either, even though my parents tried hard for me. long story short my dad let this woman move in with us when i was like 7, theyve been broken up for years but she still lives with us. over the years she has probably stolen over $1,000 worth of my belongings, probably more. she is the definition of a narcissistic leach. horrible woman.
anyways, ive dated quite a few people, and every one of them fucked me up even worse. but not like this last one. i thought i found a chill person, but as time went by they got upset when i saw my friends, stole my vapes and tried to force me into quitting nicotine with no support at all, got pissed when i smoked weed, and literally ghosted me after being together for like 7 months. honestly after that relationship i have changed so much, im not the same person and im so angry about it. i am in a relationship right now with someone i love a lot, but i literally do not know how to have a healthy relationship. i mean im definitely learning with her, but i literally just had a 4-6 hour breakdown because she didn‚Äôt call me today. and i mean a literal manic breakdown, screaming at her when she couldnt hear me, because i was alone screaming to myself. stopped going out or seeing friends because i just want to hangout with my girlfriend everyday. also struggle daily with being trans and not passing as male, but i could make a whole big post about that.
i just don‚Äôt know how to get better and heal from the past so i can have a fun happy life. i just want to have a good day but they don‚Äôt happen a lot anymore, and i feel like i have a lot of untreated mental illness.
if you read all of this, thank you, i just needed to talk about this somewhere besides my own head. ‚ù§Ô∏è

691,depression,How are you supposed to talk about your problems?,"like, I know we all say that talking to people will always be good and things like that, but why would I tell my family and friends about my problems, they're mine, I created them do that's on my to solve them.

yes, I know help would probably be more effective but... I don't want people to help me solve my problems, no matter how much I hate myself for not solving them.

Obviously, I'm stuck in a loop where I only create myself more problems while not solving any and I have no will of going out of it.

What should I do and how?

I got a somewhat depressive friend that asked me how I did to always seem happy and smile and all, what made me see the world not as a freaked up thing...

that*s the only person I ever told that I though the world what just shit, and I still have no freakin idea how I can smile so much..."
692,depression,i hate recognising that i‚Äôm in a depressive episode,"I hate noticing i‚Äôm starting/in a depressive episode because it just makes me feel even worse in a way. I like being in denial, i want to just push the feelings away and pretend like everything‚Äôs okay, and i can sometimes. but then i notice the brain fog, not being able to speak properly, the increased anxiety, the ‚Äúi don‚Äôt care about anything‚Äù attitude, the insomnia. and then i can‚Äôt ignore it, i have to sit with myself and have shitty days, knowing that i can‚Äôt get help because no body takes how i feel seriously, the mental health system here is horrible (i‚Äôve been waiting 2 years to see someone), the fact that i have to wake up and live the same lonely, anxiety riddled day over and over again. i just want to know what it feels like to be genuinely okay and happy"

I'm tired of feeling replaceable, of being the outsider looking in. I just want to be someone's first choice and not their last. I just want to matter to someone. I have a counselour and I am on medication but most days, it's too much. I used to love my job but now I hate it and I can't quit. I'm 27f, still live at home with my parents. I'm the breadwinner. I need the money. I just want to stop being so miserable all the time. I don't want to die but I don't want to live either. I just want to be free but right now? I just want a hug and a friend.

700,depression,i feel completely lost,"(tw: suicide and self-harm) i‚Äôm pretty sure i‚Äôve had depression on and off since i started high school. i can clearly remember sitting in my youth group when i was 14 and imagining how i would kill myself and all i could ever think about was how much i hated myself. that‚Äôs also when i started cutting. but i was too scared to tell my parents because they‚Äôve always seen me as the perfect child, so i never got any professional help. somehow despite all that i managed straight As throughout high school. probably due to the fact that it was the only thing that gave me any self-worth, if everything else about me was complete garbage at least i was smart right? wrong. now i‚Äôm in my second year of college. i cannot for the life of me focus on anything. i physically cannot work on my homework despite effort to try. i cant focus and i don‚Äôt care. fail all my classes whatever i don‚Äôt care anymore. now i can‚Äôt use my grades to boost my self-worth anymore, what‚Äôs even left of me? i don‚Äôt know what my parents will say or do if i fail all my classes. i don‚Äôt think my dad sees mental health as an excuse. i just can‚Äôt do it anymore. last summer was very traumatic for me and then in the fall i was so suicidal and depressed and now i just feel like a stale piece of bread sitting on a shelf. i just don‚Äôt care anymore and i‚Äôm so sick of all this. i just want to live but everything is weighing me down. i‚Äôm surprised i haven‚Äôt had a heart attack yet due to all the severe stress i‚Äôve had the past 12 months. i really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. maybe this is just a cry for help in a large void but if you‚Äôre listening thank you. please reach out to me if you‚Äôd like to talk because i could really really use someone to talk to right now"
701,depression,I feel like a fucking Zombie...,"I wake up feeling apathetic, tired and completely demotivated. Been trying to get my shit together for the past 3 months now, going in and out of sessions with my therapist, my psychiatrist and keeping up with my treatment... But it's ridiculously so fucking difficult. Some weeks just getting dressed is too much. 
I struggle to shower, to eat properly, to drink enough water, my self neglect is just making this more and more difficult. 
I've been trying non-stop to just DO, not thinking about how I feel because my therapist told me that once I get back into a rythme, things will be easier but I set traps for myself, self-sabotage and self-destructive behaviour such as drinking, self-neglect, self-harm are fucking me up. Though I realize these are due to past trauma and ways for me to ""cope"", i sometimes feel blind and walk aimlessly and slowly into one of these traps.
When I do, my inner demons whisper that it's easier to give in to the pain and wallow in my sadness. 
I make my sadness more intense through sad songs which helps me actually FEEL something. I'm slowly giving up, or have already... I don't even know why or how. My past is coming back to haunt me and I can't focus on recovery anymore. I don't want to fight. I want to give in. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts for most of my life... Since a very young age and they've always fluctuated. I will not give up on life, I will not put my loved one's through the pain that accompanies suicide, though sometimes I get swallowed by those dark thoughts until they become poisonous. I don't know if I want to fight anymore, but giving in to that feeling only makes my guilt worse. I feel like a parasite... A waste of breathe, money, love and time. I'm in love with a man who is just absolutely breathtaking and beautiful. He's helped me a lot. Unfortunately, we parted ways somewhat due to life... He knows nothing of how I feel. I'm going to see him soon, he deserves love, care and happiness, not someone as pathetic as me... I don't even know why I'm writing this here as I usually lurk. 
Sorry for the long rant, whoever reads this, thanking for taking the time to do this."

705,depression,I don't know what to do.,"I'm an A student in high school. Right now I am in freshman year. I keep procrastinating so much I am barely able to keep A's. It's really stressing me out. I have a test I haven't even studied for, and it's 10 pm right now. I don't know how to combat this. It really sucks because I get home at 3:30. I have swimming at 4:00. I get home at five. By the time I shower and eat food, it's 5:45. My school starts at 7:20(I have 0 period) so I have to wake up at 6. It's so demotivating to basically nonstop work. I can't bring myself to start immediately at 5:45, I'm just so tired. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm losing my sanity. And next year I'm taking a couple of AP and honors classes. it's just going to get harder from here on out. I don't know what to do. I'm depressed. I can barely bring myself to go to school."

Why do people hate me so much that they don't want to be associated with me? Please tell me god, if ever there is one, what I've done to deserve this kind of punishment? This is the worst feeling ever and I dont ever want to wish this empty feeling on my enemies. I cant think of anything, I dont have any personality, I'm just nothing in life and it doesn't ever get better. Maybe going in the afterlife isn't such a bad idea. What do you guys think? Maybe you could change my mind"
708,depression,I want to give up but I can‚Äôt,Ive been dealing with this for about 4-5 years and I‚Äôm tired of it. I miss having people to talk to and even if I make friends it my own fault that we stop talking. First it was when my friends went to other schools than I switched because of my depression and anxiety. I left everyone before saying anything I‚Äôm such a failure. So I went to a new school and made new friends but covid hit and we went remote. I couldn‚Äôt make it a full school week before being to freaked out and than I went online. That didn‚Äôt work. So I went to ANOTHER school. Sense I‚Äôm a fucking piece of shit it didn‚Äôt work. Because of me everyone I‚Äôve known has left. And the fact I still have people with me and I feel this way. I‚Äôm such a greedy piece of shit. My best friend and I haven‚Äôt talked in a couple months. I wish I could give up but I can‚Äôt hell I‚Äôm not even done with school so how can I get a job. I can‚Äôt have friends how can I have a girlfriend or a wife. I just wanna give up but I can‚Äôt and the facts that I thought of killing my self I just can‚Äôt get this all out of my head. I can‚Äôt tell anyone cause if I tell my parents they‚Äôll feel like there the problem (which there not there amazing) but if I tell my friends than they will say the basic things (yet again I understand) I can‚Äôt even escape my thoughts

711,depression,being stuck in past worsens my depression,"Whenever i kill the past and focus on the present to build to future i feel great , sorry I'm having hard time to express myself due my crippling depression but I'll do my best to explain it.

It's like whenever i say ""i wish i was like my old self right now"" ""i want to get my old self back"" it destroys me, it gives me so much anxiety and depression.

But whenever i think like my past self wasn't knowledge as i am right now i feel much better, like my old self wasn't knowledge as i am right now, but still he didn't have any mental issues and he used to love himself.

Like even tho i suffered severely from depression and anxiety atleast i learned so many new things and now I'm more knowledge about life. I was kinda closed minded in past , now I'm more open minded and learned so many new things about life and the world, i evolved so much.

Like if i realize and accept this i feel great cuz i don't fight to get my old self back anymore, i right to improve myself from the current situation by evolving even more.

It's like i need to destroy past and evolve to a better me and love my current self, don't you think that ?"
712,depression,How does employment affect your depression?,"I've been looking at it lately, and I feel like employment is honestly the source of my issues at this point.

The math of it being, if I'm up at 8am, and intend on being asleep by 12am, so I can get a solid 8 hours of sleep, and I'm not home til 7:30/8, basically 12 of my hours are accounted for. Four hours remain, but about 30/45 minutes of that is getting to bed/sleep. So there's like 3.5 hours remaining. And I should still eat. Which, is either cereal, or something else horrid for me, or I spend 30mn-1hr making something actually good, so I can be left with 2.5 hours remaining, and I'll probs take 10-30 minutes to eat it, depending on what it is. So as little as 2 hours ACTUALLY remain in my day after work.

Of course, I get more time to myself by neglecting myself. Most nights I'll ""go to bed"" and be doing anything else on my phone than sleeping because I just don't want to teleport back to work by closing my eyes.

Of course, there's 32 hours a week that aren't on working days, but working days are the worst. I may as well be dead. It'd be just as beneficial for me to stand outside in the street for twelve hours with my eyes closed. I'd get just as much value out of it. I'm just throwing my time away.

Though then again, maybe I'd get more out of that. I'm vitamin d deficient, so if I could get some time outside, that would be better, too."

715,depression,looking for help at the bottom of the barrel,"Hi, new to reddit but I'm not sure where else to look. I read over the rules and I‚Äôm trying to stay in the guidelines but apologies if I falter.

I was diagnosed with depression spring 2020. This was just the first time I saw a professional, I have been in what I like to refer to as a hole for much longer. I have shut myself off from my emotions and my peers. I never talk about my feelings, often it feels like my apathy is the only thing inside me. I am a university student but I am slowly but surely failing out. Everyday I wake up later than I want to wishing I didn‚Äôt wake up at all. I had a good childhood and outsiders would say I have a good life now but I have never been able to shake the constant feeling of emptiness. I do well socially and can achieve a goal if I want it bad enough and work hard enough. My problem is I don‚Äôt want anything and dont have the motivation to work. I just wish I didn‚Äôt exist, not to kill myself as I would ultimately hurt my loved ones more than help myself, but I wish I never existed in the first place. I am surrounded by my failures and hate the person staring back at me in the mirror. I feel I have the foundations to be the person I want to be but I don‚Äôt even know who that is. I want to rid myself of this burden, not through medication and therapy but through myself. I want to redefine who I am now to allow myself to become whoever I want. I've always been told I can do whatever I want and I know that I can, I just don‚Äôt want to be anyone.¬†

I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to better myself past the obvious google searches. I have tried therapy, medications, and lifestyle changes but nothing sticks. I don‚Äôt feel better talking on a couch about my feelings, taking an ssri everyday, or opening up to my loved ones. I want to fulfill my potential and will do most anything to get past the urge to stop hating every second of my life.¬†

Any advice is greatly appreciated. If this isn‚Äôt the place to look a point in the right direction would be just as valuable"

720,depression,The hardest part about getting better is finding a reason to.,"The means to get better are easy to find (i.e. exercise, making friends, getting a hobby, therapy) but it‚Äôs just to simple for me to worm out of committing to them because I don‚Äôt care about getting better. 

My psychologist says maybe just trying to get better and THEN figuring out what I‚Äôm doing it for is the best solution but that sounds delusional.

Truly there is no reason for me to get better. It just isn‚Äôt there. I‚Äôm not at any stage in my life where anyone is really dependent on me. I am friendless. I wasn‚Äôt ever raped or abused so I have nobody to really ‚Äúspite‚Äù. I‚Äôm kinda just a loser without reason. 

There isn‚Äôt really any reason for me to have a lust for my existence like most other people have. I just don‚Äôt value my life.

727,depression,looking for advice on saving money,"I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD. This combination makes a really difficult to save money. I struggled to just get a job for years. I'm 27, going on 28, and live at home with my parents. I had a job and just quit that job for a better one. The pay is about the same but with a fraction of the physical and mental stress. 

I feel better with this new job. The last one was kicking my ass. Again, physically and mentally. But that doesn't mean I don't still have depression and ADHD. I spend a lot of money, and most of it on things that are NOT necessities. 

I want to really start saving money though, while I don't ha e bills to pay, or rent, or any of that. It's the smart thing to do, but I am really struggling. I set up a savings account that takes 100$ from every paycheck I get, so a little bit of a cushion is starting to build there, but I'm still spending way too much money on a weekly basis. 

So, I'm just looking for other suggestions on how to save money and cope with this stuff more. I spend to make myself feel better with new stuff. Even though I know it won't help me in the long run. 

So, advice is welcome."

729,depression,"may have dated a pedo, don't think meds are going to help","my ex boyfriend became emotionally, then physically abusive. i caught him looking at pictures of young girls. have not gone through puberty young. i had always believed it was due to a mental health issue, but now i don't know.  i tried to help him.  he  stopped taking any medication, except Adderall, and stopped seeing a therapist.  

i cant stand myself anymore. i called a suicide hotline one night, when i told them i had started self harming again, and was embarrassed, they replied ""oh at your age, that is embarrassing.""

 lets just say i don't think i will be ready for bikini season.  unless i wear one of those bikini bottoms with the skirt thing. i keep it to the upper thighs. 

i have been seeing a shrink, a therapist, and found a recovery from  domestic violence group. 

my shrink has added on different medications, but i don't think there is a pill in the world that can make me feel okay. sometimes i vomit when i get really anxious.  this is the first time in my life i have had a scale, because im trying to gain weight. What he was looking at makes me afraid that anyone who finds me attractive, is attracted to the same kind of thing he was. 

i feel like a lot of people don't believe me.... about the CP,  and  the abuse. How he behaved  when other people were around vs when we were alone,  was very different. It kind of made it hurt more seeing how nice he was to other people, but would just pretend like i didn't exist, or worse when we were alone.

i had already struggled with depression and anxiety, and that's the way i had met him, an online support group. 

Now, i hate leaving my house.  i hate how i look. i don't like being around people. i stay away from social media. i told some of the prominent social media people that are associating with him . i shouldn't have, because everyone thinks he's amazing and i'm just a crazy ex. Even though i have known him for at least 5 years, lived with him for 2 years. They have known him just over the internet for a few months. 

i did report what i saw to the relevant authorities, but  i think he's too smart to get caught. 

There was an an open investigation on him a few years ago, one reason was due to the CP. 

TL;DR 

i dated and cohabitated someone who may have been a pedo (caught him looking at naked little girls), i hate myself for it. i dont leave my house most days. A lot of people don't believe me. They think hes a great person, and im a crazy cunt.  im not suicidal, but i keep hoping i just die in my sleep."

743,depression,"Missing school, good thing or not?","Obviously I‚Äôm aware missing school isn‚Äôt the answer but if I want to find some time to heal myself, then should it be allowed?

Has anyone had the same experience?"
744,depression,I'm too young for this thing called depression.,"So I'm 16 years old and I think I've had depression for atleast over a year but I don't want to go see someone about it because I don't want my parents and other family to worry about me right now.

My dad has recently been putting pressure on me to get an apprenticeship(An apprenticeship is like a job and school combined, you train for a number of years for it) for panel beating (which is repairing dents in transport) and it's been pushing me further into darkness and I haven't a clue what I want to do after I leave school rather it be this year or next. I'm afraid that I'm gonna be 25 with no job still living with my parents.

Before this I went through a faze where I would barely talk to any of my friends at and after school. They put the pieces of the puzzle together, and they would all tell me that life would get better and that that'd hope I feel better. They try force me to go to the school counselor which I don't want because they notfiy my parents about it and then I'll put pressure on them when they work their asses off for me and I feel so ungrateful because I show barely any emotions anymore. Even before that faze I was bullied because I was the ""pussy"" and the ""waste of oxygen"" at school and alot of people hated and still hate me.

5 or so years ago I was such a cheerful young boy that would get along with everything and everything I would draw cool little pictures and give them to my friends and family, but now I don't have any energy to do anything anymore. All I do is go to school, sleep in most of my classes, come home and lie in my bed and scroll through some social media till I cry myself to sleep which would be around 11 then wake up the next day at 7 and go to school. 

I feel so empty inside all the time and just of late I somehow got a crush on this really nice and cool girl at school, so I plucked up the courage to ask her out but she sadly rejected me.

I want to end it all right now, I feel like theirs nothing and nobody in this world for me even though so many people care about me. And I honestly don't want them to care so much because theres nothing special about me at all.

I congratulate you if you've read all this thank you for your time. Please older people please tell me it will get better"
745,depression,How do I help someone with a different kind of depression?,"People react differently to stress. Me? (F21) Im the sensitive empath.

He gets so mad at himself, is annoyed with everyone, ignores all his problems &amp; possible solutions. I love him &amp; care about him very much &amp; at our core, we have the same feelings, we just express them differently.

However, all of us in this subreddit know that people that don‚Äôt help themselves &amp; don‚Äôt want to be helped, cannot be helped.

He‚Äôs very hot &amp; cold with this bc he‚Äôs fine when he‚Äôs calm but as soon as he‚Äôs overwhelmed he gets extremely irritable/rude. I can‚Äôt allow that but I also understand. Any advice? :/"

My psychiatrist took me off my Prozac (40mg) to put me on this other drug and so I haven't been taking my pills because I can't and I'm getting so much worse

I sleep nearly all day and I don't eat much anymore. I just don't care. I don't. I've realized my life and my struggles are a joke. ""You're not the only one,"" and ""you have all the resources to get better,"" or, ""just go."" Yeah thanks. That makes me feel so much better. Thanks for the pep-talk. 

I just wanna put a gun to my head and pull the trigger. I've been doing so well dammit. I hadn't hurt myself in a few months and I was happy for the first time in years and now I'm sobbing and punching myself and dreading the morning when my mom realizes that I'm going to skip again

it‚Äôs really hard to explain but i never feel comfortable in my skin i constantly feel intrusive thoughts and a general desire to not want to exist. it‚Äôs not really a typical depressed or anxious feeling as i‚Äôm used to, more a weird and uncomfortable feeling of despair and confusion. it makes me not want to exist anymore because it‚Äôs so uncomfortable and confuses me so much on if what i‚Äôm thinking is right or not and why i feel so freaked out by things once normal to me.

The lady who did my monthly phone calls told me the adult services had decided to accept me and offer me care, so I thought great! I'm going to get therapy. I then stopped getting the monthly phone calls out of nowhere (seemingly unrelated to my 18th birthday) and then randomly got a call from a doctor at camhs (not the adult services) (not a therapist) who said she was putting me on medication. Ok, fine. I still didn't get any check in calls. I got one to see how the medication was doing and refill my prescription when it was running out. The other day I got my first call from them in a couple months. It was the doctor telling me I'm being discharged from their services. After the other woman told me they had accepted me. I've been sat here waiting for and expecting (only given what I was told by them) therapy sessions. And now they suddenly call me up out of no where to tell me they won't give it to me, when one of their employees TOLD me they would. CRUEL. dangle it in front of the depressed person why don't you"

765,depression,I turn 30 tomorrow. Thinking back on my twenties.,"I have suffered from mental illness my whole life. But depression particularly since my teens.

Looking back on the last decade, I think the biggest theme has been loss of hope. I had one girlfriend in the last decade. And I do miss her. I miss having someone to talk and laugh with. Someone who smiled at me like I was special and important. I miss driving from my university to hers on Fridays and spending time with her before taking her back home for the weekend. I miss intimacy. I miss her family. I miss her house. I miss going to restaurants and taking vacations with them.

But I think what I miss the most is feeling hope. I used to believe, even at my darkest moments, that things could get better. Depression is what ended the relationship, and in the 6 years since then, I've stopped believing things can be better. And now I am entrenched in a rut so deep that I don't see how to crawl my way out.

It was like having a few years where I got to experience what it's like to be a real person, and now I'm just a husk."

776,depression,Seeking solace in nostalgia and its comforting certainty,"The future could be anything and so it's easier to drift back into the forged archives of the past. Like re-watching a movie that we learn the words to we revel in the certainty and familiarity. Hand-picking moments that gave us the most joy to revisit.

But the joy is short lived and the price we pay can be deep. Frustration that these moments can not be replicated. That you are walking through the past on your own. That in your reminiscent world the people exist only as they did then. You cling to a past which your present self can form no new connection with.

Is the past something we think about more when the present or future feel bleak? Is it the brains way of attempting to reconnect to something positive, to save us from depression? But in that attempt sometimes making us feel more low?  don't want to keep going back there, I'd like to enjoy new moments as they happen. 

""To live in the moment"". A cliche but a strong sentiment. I think it's something I only ever done when I was young. When work or finances or relationships were less important. I would love to get back to that place."

782,depression,I feel like a token for people to say they are inclusive.,"This is my first time ever posting anything on reddit besides comments, so I'm sorry if this is like really bad or stupid or something. I have a personality disorder and it sucks because I have to fight with myself everyday just to act and feel normal and sometimes I can't do it. I can't always fight off these thoughts and changes that can happen on a dime making me do bad things. Thankfully it's been nothing too bad but I feel as though my friends are slipping away from me unable to actually deal with me and when I vent my frustrations or these intrusive thoughts in my head I get silenced or ignored. It makes this dark depressed feeling inside eat away at me slowly. As of recent I have been accused of doing something absolutely atrocious and I can't say anything to prove it otherwise since I'm the crazy guy so all of my friends just abandoned me and called me said disgusting thing even though it's not true. I hate that I'm just a sign for them to say they are inclusive to people with mental problems too. They can't bear my issues and throw me away and make people who don't know me and people who do hate me with false claims when I become too much to handle and I'm sick of it. I'm a good person fighting to be normal and I'm doing a great job climbing up, it's just not fair."

Not to mention they will expect me to buy a house for them and take care of them. I can‚Äôt even take care of myself. I hate responsibilities. 

I suddenly want to block them. I don‚Äôt care if I end up dying somewhere, but I just want to run away for some peace of mind for maybe 5 to 10 years. My parents call me every single day to ask how I perform at work and to remind me to check my bank balance so that I‚Äôm on track with ‚Äúmy‚Äù goal.

785,depression,How do many people get through their days despite a lack of meaning?,"Right now, I'm OK, but I had a rather little depressive episode just recently. And this made me think about a think once again: How do many (maybe even most?) people just do all the stuff we have to do without becoming nuts? Don't most people (at least in less religious countries) also think that there either is no such thing as a meaning of life? If so, then how do people find so much motivation to do stuff and not get depressed? 

I wasn't (or at least only occasionally) depressed for about 2 years now, but I think that only worked because of an effective strategy for escapism which currently doesn't work no more.

I heard about all this absurdist or existentialist ""you have to give your life a meaning"" but that's exactly what doesn't work anymore because I had to cheat myself for it to work."

Time passed, I worked, got my snakes, met my wife, bought the house, then health issue, lost job, lost back, grandpa died.

All I do now is watching youtube, vaping weed, prepare dinner for mylady when she get back from work, and go to that ""spine school"" twice a week for training my back. Oh and care about my grandma.   
I'm supposed to find a new job after the back training, don't really know what to do, I've been jobless for more than a year now. Thinking about dubbing actor; without putting much energy or faith in it, having no connexions nor experience yet in that domain.  


Will then only remains my wife and my snakes as last attachments...

I don't know where I'm going or how long it will last.

Maybe I'll get by another day to tell you all how it went.   
I'll probably watch events around me and do nothing as usual.

**TLD/DR:** **This is going nowhere, no question or nothing, I just wanted to vent I guess.**  


Take care you all. Your life are all precious, nevermind how worthless you feel."

I dragged my battered body into the vehicle and took myself to hospital. 

There, I showed up at the emergency department, covered in blood and bruises. 

A doctor asked, ‚ÄúWhat seems to be the problem, sir?‚Äù I had to explain to him, in great detail, exactly what my injuries were, and convince him that they were real. 

He warmly congratulated me for seeking help. Then he handed me a first-aid kit, left an after-dinner mint on my pillow, and went home.

At the most vulnerable, confusing moments in our lives, public health messaging encourages us to ring helplines or visit our doctors. I believed that if I waved a white flag, someone would ride in on a white horse and carry me to safety. It takes a lot of courage to admit to a stranger that you‚Äôre struggling, and instead my doctor saw me for 15 minutes, wrote out a prescription for white antidepressant pills and ushered me out the door."

Now class is depressing as fuck. I just fall asleep lonely. My best friend in school moved last year. Honestly the boys are pretty ass. I miss her a lot. I don't have friends in school. I'm a weird kid. I don't listen to mainstream music, I don't play a whole lot of video games. I hate sports generally and I just spend my free time reading sheet music that I brought with me.

807,depression,I need some help,"Hello, fellow teens

I am currently living in a rough situation. In my current household, I live with my parents and brother. I want your opinion on what i should do , or if I am right or wrong.  I live in a middle-class household so money is not a problem here. I have arguments with my parents and usually, I think I am right. The following argument is what has happened, but take some of them with a little grain of salt

scenario one: I don't really like people touching my stuff(I don't think it is related to ocd but more on the side that I known where everything is in my room and from past experience my mother has damaged those items I had). I have told my mother multiple time not to clean up my room. In this past week, my room has gotten a little messy and i got told to clean it up. I have agreed to clean it up. During the week I got a heavy-workload from school assignment and test coming up at the end. So like every other teen out there I worked very hard on them. Due to the event of working on school i stayed up very late and had no time to clean up my room. After my mother sees that I haven't cleaned up my room she decides to clean it up even when I told her not to muliple times beforehand. This is mainly due to her breaking my office pc last time. For the past months I felt lonely afterwards because video games are my only stress reliver at the moment. Anyways when I came back from school( I walk to school and back from school) I find out she cleaned out my room while I was away. I immently freaked out because Some of my stuff is missing. he saids it is not a big deal but I am missing items that were there beforehand or otherwise they had been damaged. This is not the frist time this has happened before. Once she tried to move my pc and it stopped working( this was mention above). Anyways I have lot of damaged items and missing one from the outcome of her actions. My mother also sell this clothing that make your skinner but I think the group is.pyramid sceme because it recruits more people( If you live in markham ares then don't but the product it gives no benefites. Anyways she starts to leave everyday for  the whole day and comeback at 8 to 9 in the evening. Once when I was sleping she came back home and ring the bell. I of course didn't hear and later when she got into the house guess who got yelled at for not opened the door after she party all day with her flirty work friends?

scenario 2: In my household I get blamed for everything. Yes, i know the older sibling usually gets blamed for stuff but when I mean everything I mean everything. My dad would not even question if something was done with my brother but instead go straight to be and proceeds to yell at me. An example of this is when he find out his t shirts are missing but goes to me and complains that i have taken them. After he proceeds to yell at me for about 3 mintuies but brother comes along and admitts he took his t-shirt. What makes me so saltly if that he get away with everything. Whenever my brother get in trouble it is away told to him not yelled and screamed at. He would always get off the hook with a warning while I always get yelled at and then he compain for the rest of the day of how bad of a son i am. That I am a waste of money and a piece of trash. I really don't think this is a good way to parent your kids. My father had always had an anger issue with him. For example when I was growning up whenever I did something wrong (yes I do attmitted I did some things that were clearly in the wrong but I was young at the age of 8-10) he would smash something I valued. An example of this would be a lego set or my macbook air . I would ask my father ahs anger issue because of the things mentioned above. I never got everything I wanted unlike my brother. Whenever my brother asked for something he always got it. While I can't get anything. I am not allowed to get another pc because my mother distoryed the one I had beforehand. Since I live in a place where I connect with people online ,it been a really rought few months. If anyone has any suggestion on how to make money as a teen plz put it down below! Since my dad dosen't ask question about what happeneds. Whenever I have a fight with my mom, he always defends my mom. My mother side of the story would always make her look the best. An example of this would be me taking a shower. When I take a shower and I see take my towel if not there afterwards( I had to walk to my room to get something to dry myself). while in the process I made a trail of water. My mother immdatiey notices and then compains to my father. I agreed to mope it up. I got in for less then 5 seconds and mom brustes in. When doing so I tell her to leave so I can clean it up. She then starts to compain about how there water but she was the one to take my towel in the frist place. I think taking my towel without warning takes some of the blame on her. So I close the door but the devil of a bitch throws the door open with the speed of a crackhead on the loose. That it hits my toe and a piece breaks off the door. She then calls my dad over and this bitch had the courage to say "" look at this useful son, all he does is ruin our house"". ""he made our floors wet( dosen't mention the towel that was taken for me). She then sayes("" he broke a piece of the door""). No, you insane son of a bitch you broke it in your dumbass trying to come in for no reasons at all. When I said I will go mope the floors. 

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario 3:

My brother is a spoiled brat. He would brother me at all cost because he knows that my dad and mom would be on his side no matter the reason. I could be sitting in any other room in our house and this brother of mines would come up and hit me. Not just that, I have noticed to not trust him ever! This mans snitches if he get a treat out of it. You cannot trust this him. This man is so spoiled by my parents that he get everything he wants, when he want a coach bag he got one. I get one pillow that is not good(so i asked my mom for one good one) she rejects and then give him two really good ones. This mans doesn't do his schoolwork so last year he didn't even get a mark on his report card. My mom would be proud of him even thought I got 85-95 mark last year. Since she dosen't care about marks anymore, my grades started to slip this year. When he gets home all he does is watch youtube videos and when I am caught on my computer usually doing schoolwork , my parents compain about me still. Even if i have not left my room all day I still hear then complain about me because I am always the one to get blamed. I don't think I can stand this much longer.Everyday I live here has been a nightmare. My grades are slipping now so I don't know what to even do. I can't deal with this work enviroment when I get home for a tired day at home. I need some suggestion to what to do to improve my living situation. Plz don't joke about this I think I am getting depressed! I don't have video games to cheer me up, I have very limited friends nowdays, I get blamed with everything in the household, and my brother is a spoild brat. I think I might have depression because of this. If there anything that could help?"
808,depression,It helps to see other people Happy,"I‚Äôve been in this depressive state for along time. I‚Äôm not sure I understand why but for some reason it just feels good to see other people Happy or enjoying life. Even though I feel as if my whole world is burning down, it‚Äôs awesome to see friends and family doing good. Not sure what this means but i fear it means I no longer care about myself, or that I care more about others."
809,depression,Sexual Abuse,"I'm writing this with the last ounce of life left in me .

&amp;#x200B;

If you have suffered from sexual abuse you need to talk to someone about it as soon as possible before the trauma energy associated with feeling sexually abused consumes you.

&amp;#x200B;

I got molested on my 12th birthday and got jumped the next day for being a fag that sucked dick, it took me 10 years to snap out of that beating and realize i'm not gay and I got sexually abused. 

&amp;#x200B;

The damage was already done and within years of being sexually abused, I sexually was innapropriate with my family and got labelled a sex offender or a pedophile, that has haunted me for my entire life and i have never been able to become a person. 

this year I apologized to my family for my actions in my youth and I finally told my family for the first time since incident that I was infact molested and almost sodomized on my 12th birthday party sleepover.

&amp;#x200B;

My life is stolen and robbed to trauma and i'll never be the same kid again. I dont want to carry on living.

if this posts seems similar to anyone, please apologize for your actions and face them before you spend the rest of your life thinking youre a sexual predator when it was your trauma that introduced those intrusive thoughts into your mind. I dont know what to say anymore, I feel demonic and no one thought to ask me if i was sexually abused as a kid. I notice the demons in my mind, I'm still fighting intrusive thoughts, anytime the world pedophile comes up I immediately get red flashes and I feel sick even though that word is far from me, its a part of my abuse."
810,depression,I really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.,"I feel like I‚Äôm stuck. Or like something is missing, I keep trying to better myself and be better for the people around me. I keep having suicidal thoughts and I‚Äôve been on and off medicine after medicine, I recently got prescribed adhd medication by my psychiatrist and it just feels like I have more motive to do stuff, but also more Motivation to finally end it, after spending 6-7 years of struggling with depression and it‚Äôs been up and down but it always comes back to the suicidal thoughts and I just want it to stop. I‚Äôm sorry if I don‚Äôt make sense or I‚Äôm rambling I‚Äôm trying hard to explain. I just want someone to tell me what the fuck Is wrong with me, therapy just stops working, and I have a bunch to be happy about but sometimes none of it matters, no one matters, I‚Äôm tired of feeling like I have to be saved, I tried working out and I‚Äôve been pretty successful, but it‚Äôs not enough, I know how to play 3 instruments and it‚Äôs not enough, I have support. But it‚Äôs not enough. I wanna start a career but I just tell myself ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point‚Äù I have little moments of bliss and honestly they keep me around, but I guess I feel like no one could ever love me because of this, the constant self doubt, the flippy-floppiness with my emotions, I try to avoid the constant pain and suffering, and I‚Äôm really trying to be happy I am, I love seeing other people around me happy, and it gives me life. But I also can‚Äôt help but feel envy and shame. Why is it so easy for everyone else to be slightly okay. I don‚Äôt know. Rant over"

812,depression,The worst thing about depression for me,"Depression itself is awful. Everybody talks about that. 

But nobody talks much about what to do if you don't think you can take care of yourself anymore. Why aren't more people worried about that? Are homelessness and suicide the only options? I don't actually want to kill myself but am so worried I might have to. There isn't really anyone I can trust or depend on. I don't understand why there aren't more posts about this. Being miserable in bed or on the couch for periods is awful. Sadness is awful. But losing everything is unbearable. Losing home, family, friends, looks, all your money and savings. No career. I don't see how one can recover."
813,depression,I've failed.,"At this point, it seems like the depression might as well just win. 

I've been trying so hard to improve myself amidst difficult circumstances and mental health issues. 

Whether it's regular therapy, medication, exercise, socialising, hanging out with my dog, it just doesn't seem to be working. 

I even managed to snag a higher paying job that I've been dreaming about but it's still so hard to get out of bed and stop crying. 

I feel like everyone hates me. 

My partner laughs at my sadness. When I confided in my family member about it, they suggested I remind him what it's like when I'm happy. 

I can't. I get that people get sick of you being sad. HELL. I'm sick of being sad. 

I don't know where I'm going with this. I just feel worthless and defeated and I don't know how much longer I can keep trying."

The dynamic would be the same, everyone would be just as good friends, and the group would look virtually the same. It‚Äôs not hard to see that my friends are better friends with each other than with me and while I‚Äôm not against them having better friendships, it hurts how apparent it is and how big the gap is. Any time I‚Äôve hung out with friends, I‚Äôll hear stories about other times they‚Äôve hung out, definitely without me. Just earlier today I was leaving to go on a walk and I saw a groups of my friends heading to another friend‚Äôs dorm, and I was never told anything. I don‚Äôt expect to be invited to or involved with everything, but this isn‚Äôt the first time and it still hurts. I feel like if I just distanced myself or left entirely, I‚Äôd have no one. I‚Äôd be completely alone at college if I left the people who actively exclude me and I have no idea what to do. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a bad friend in a way I don‚Äôt realize, if I‚Äôve done something that I don‚Äôt realize, or if it‚Äôs just all in my head."
818,depression,How do I unlearn negative beliefs about myself?,"So I have a few learned behaviors and beliefs from my childhood that are affecting me now in adulthood. My parents told me often I was useless and retarded, and I find myself living as if these things are true. It took a long time to realize that my negative self talk stems from those experiences, but my subconscious is still believing these things. So I know where it‚Äôs from, but how do I stop believing it? How do I move on and stop self sabotaging myself due to the fact that I think I‚Äôm useless?"

I've been told I'm not worth the trouble, that I'm insufferable. It is true but still. Everyone in this damn world seems so cruel and selfish.  How are there so many depressed lonely people in the world and I can't find one that will put up with me? It makes no sense to me. I just don't want to be alone my whole life until I'm dead ffs. No matter how I struggle or pretend to be someone else it always ends the same. I am alone and I'm probably going to die alone. That just makes me want to end it now and get it over with. I can't handle that nobody will ever love me for me. I'm just so angry and I hate everything and want it to be over. Anyone I talk to online ghosts me it has destroyed any shred of hope I cling onto. I can hardly even try anymore because I know it will end the same anyway. It is a cycle of trying, failing, over and over and over and it will only end when I kill myself because the alternative is : somebody gives me a chance and we become friends forever and doesn't that sound lovely? somebody doesn't  mind I'm a loser freak HAHAHAHAH that will never happen. No wonder I have no friends. I'm clearly going insane. Sorry you had to read this"
821,depression,I Cannot Give Myself Morale Boosts,"I have never given myself morale boosts. Thinking back on my entire life, then and now I can safely say at no point has my brain ever went ""you can do it"",""You got this"",""You tried hard but you will get it next time"", etc. I can only thing in negatives or a completely blank slate and to encourage myself I need to manually think about doing it, think of the words and say it and it all comes across as so forced and fake that I just feel like a pathetic loser needing to this and I just feel worse than thinking nothing.

I feel like this is just a part of my brain I was never born with. I could blame my upbringing and life and how I cannot recall a single time that anyone; friends, family, superiors, teachers, etc. have ever given me any morale support or encouragement. I can't think of a single thing at all where people were supporting, just a gigantic wave of no one really caring or smiling and nodding. Fuck even now whenever I see people encouraging or supporting I think it's completely fake and bullshit or just an automatic canned response even if they are genuine I cannot believe them and I think people are just forced to say this due to how society is. I think that not a single person gives a fuck about anyone else and will constantly be disappointed, talk shit about someone behind their back or just completely uncaring and I don't know why this is. 

I don't think all the help in the world can help me on this one and it kills me inside and makes me want to cry I am like this. I want help but I can't believe any of it and I can't convince myself to ever say nice things about myself or to amp myself up or anything. How can I even take a therapists words to hear if I think everything is bullshit?"

I always think it's because I am too stressed and dishonest to myself."
823,depression,Chronic pain is killing me physically and mentally,I just feel like I'm full of all the problems that anyone can go through but the worst of them is the physical pain. Everyday I go to sleep with migraines and stomach aches that makes me want to just die and the feeling when waking up is just worse. I cant do many of the normal activities because of my health. I've went to doctors so many times but they also give me medicine that doesnt really help. Also I keep thinking how my body and face looks like shit so my body dysmorphia isnt helping with my mental state. The thing is I was never born like this is all result of my bad habits that slowly got worse over the years and i regret it every single day for not stopping while I had a chance. There is a lot to more to say but even typing this feels too tiring. I'm just thinking of suicide every single day and I cant imagine when it gets worse.
824,depression,I can't stop thinking that's something's wrong with me,"Posting this on my usual depression-related throwaway account.

I've been trying so hard these past months. I'm on my meds, I'm working out, saving money so I can move. I'm doing hobbies again, taking care of my chores. Emotionally I'm better than I've been in years.

But it still doesn't help. I'm still alone. I have one friend who lives two states away from me and rarely talks to me. I'm head over heels in love with my only other friend, but she's moving 300 miles away to live with her ex and I'll likely never see her again. I've dated off and on this past year, but I can never make it more than a month before I'm passed over for someone else. Before that, I can't even begin to count the number of friends I've lost just because they stop talking to me. One minute things are fine, the next minute they're gone.

It's like the theme of my life. No matter who I meet, no matter who I befriend, they always leave. And most times, they leave me for someone else. And I know it's my depression talking, but I can't help but feel like it's because something is inherently wrong with me. That I don't get to be with people because I'm fundamentally wrong inside and everyone but me can see it.

I don't know how to fix this. I don't know if it can be fixed. But I'm scared to even try anymore because I don't know if the new people I find will just wind up hurting me more. I'm 27 years old, but I feel like I'm struggling with shit that an 8-year-old has figured out already.

I'm sorry if this came off whiny. I just don't know anymore."
825,depression,Even when things are going well I‚Äôm still thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather be dead than alive‚Äù,Because at the end of the day. It‚Äôs all meaningless.

Every time I try to do better, I end up feeling the same. I'm over-weight and I tell myself that it's okay and I will start exercising and eating better but I have no motivation 99% of the time and I also every time I visit my dad, he is always telling me I need to drink water and he compares me to my sister who is the skinny one. I sometimes do starve myself for days and then I will binge.

I know I need professional help because I always have those bad thoughts that I'm not good enough, I'm too fat, everyone would be better off without me, I just want to kill myself, but I can't get help. I have no insurance and don't money to pay a hospital or a therapist. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this, my partner always gets upset when I do talk to them about it, and I don't have any friends. I've always been too sensitive, and every little thing just makes me think too much. I can never stay at a job for too long, people can be so fucking rude too you over nothing.

I've tried doing drugs and drinking but my body doesn't like to react to it how it should. It takes me double and triple the amount with drugs just too feel something that last more than a minute and I can drink all I want but my brain always has to ruin it. One minute I will be all drunk and happy and then the next I will be sober and in my head. 

I just want to die. I believe in God, and I pray to Him all the time to just let me come home to Him, but now I don't even want to do that because I feel like I'm disappointing Him or/ making Him annoyed. 

I tried killing myself three times but the only thing it did was make me feel like shit, I'm pretty sure I fucked up my kidney.

I don't know what to do anymore, I can't kill myself correctly and living just so hard, but then I feel guilty about feeling this way because I have so much when others have so little. And now I might be pregnant, I hungry and tired all the time now. I have to take another test in a couple days because the line was too faint. I don't want to bring a baby into this shitty world, plus being pregnant and depressed is bad for the baby."
832,depression,Progress doesn't help,"Tired of seeing advice for depression having to due with progress and improving life. That if you get 1% better everyday that things will get back to 100%. It's simply not true. 

Three years ago, I never left me bed and smoked weed constantly. I paid for university and didn't go to a single class. I didn't talk to anyone, online and especially in person. I did 0 things in a day but exist. 

Two years ago, I got a job working 9-5 at minimum wage. I saved up and paid off my student debt fully. I bought myself clothes and games and even managed to make some connections with coworkers. I was sober. On my time off work however, I just sat and thought of how I'm not accomplishing much, and this was to be my life forever. 

This year, I'm back in university. Im only a half year away from graduating with a finance degree, and have been getting top marks in most my classes. I work out 3-4 times a week and diet on top. I sometimes go out on weekends with friends to get drinks. At night, I smoke a little and read a lot. I have a balanced day start to finish that's often full with responsibilities I fulfill. 

You know what hasn't changed? I'm depressed. Maybe worst than I was more. I'm closer to ending it. It doesn't matter what I add or subtract. I find no meaning to life. This is an illness, not a life state."

Since yesterday her phone is turned off and she won't respond to anyone's texts. I visited L but her mother told me that she wasn't home and has gone for a walk. Me, being stubborn, decided to find her. I check out a couple of her favorite places and found her in nearby town. I gave her sweets that I bought for her earlier and sat besides her in silence.
I knew that she takes long walks to avoid people so I didn't want to force any conversations. 
After 2 hours of wandering around the town L headed to her home. I walked her there and we parted ways. 

Her phone is still turned off. I don't know what should I do. Will visiting her today be fine or is it too much? Will it be too selfish and annoying? I don't want make her angry but I'm really worried. Her mental state was getting worse lately and I don't want to let her attempt again.

855,depression,My experience...," 

Hi Everyone 

I just joined this group and wanted to share an experience I hope will offer encouragement to anyone who is in the same position I once found myself. Earlier in my life I had some serious issues with anxiety and depression. After spending some time utilising various coping mechanisms I experienced a particularly difficult period. This experience was horrific. It made me wish I had never been born. But it terrified me so much it spurned me into action. I decided to abandon the coping strategy I had clung to and pursue the root cause of my issues. I believed that if I found the root cause I would be able to address this and cure myself of these symptoms for good. I made a list of treatments I thought might allow me to do this. I worked my way through this list. One of these approaches allowed me to get to the root cause of my depression and anxiety and resolve the issue. I went from being someone who was being crushed by the weight of my emotions to someone who wakes up with an optimistic attitude to life‚Äôs challenges. I now start my days with a genuine excitement about the future. I walked this path and made this transition. If you walk this path you can make the same discoveries, the same changes and be cured.¬†"

People always take advantage of me they abuse me backstabbing me. I don't want to know anymore with the world I just want to stay home and not go out but I cant. I'm always fking scared I cant even go to a place that I want to go important errands like the bank alone or to the doctor alone my anxiety goes up to a 100000 apart from that I am desperate desperate to be alone and I feel doomed a lot doomed I'm always depressed crying everyday nothing can make me feel better.

861,depression,i think i‚Äôm going back into depression,hi. i‚Äôm 18 years old and i‚Äôve been depressed for about 2 1/2 years now. it started my sophomore year and it was just normal depression over silly things i almost feel like break up losing my friends and just growing up. but it got worse into covid. i started smoking a lot and it wasn‚Äôt the best i dropped the sport i loved and just a stayed home and watched tv all day. i finally started to get out of it towards the end of the year and went back to football but i lost my best friend before the year ended. i‚Äôm not sure i haven‚Äôt ever felt the same since i‚Äôve felt like i always see people with best friend they‚Äôre always with 24/7 and i just guess i never have it and don‚Äôt think i ever will. i also had a crush on this girl for 2 years but she had a bf they‚Äôre broken up and i told her how i feel but i don‚Äôt think she feels the same plus she just got out it doesn‚Äôt affected me much anymore idk y but i just have accepted it and all. i talked to one girl who really liked me but we couldn‚Äôt date because she‚Äôs going to another college. i asked her to prom but she already got asked. i haven‚Äôt ever been to a dnace really so i‚Äôm really nervous about it which is crazy but yeah so it‚Äôs just hard and i‚Äôm scared i won‚Äôt get to go to my last dance because idk who would go with me. i‚Äôm not ugly i think i‚Äôm the opposite but it‚Äôs just hard idk where to go anymore and all my fun was wasted by me.
862,depression,I have been existentially depressed and chronically bored for years.,"It started when I was 12 or so, I don‚Äôt remember what it was like very well back then, but I do remember dodging responsibilities and I got bored of things I used to like etc. I believe it came about after rejecting Christian religious beliefs after realizing it‚Äôs just a mythology that the indoctrinated indoctrinate to young, naive children. I got professional heath, and felt better. Got depressed again after a while, but this time with suicidal thoughts. I got professional heath again, but that did me nothing. Though I did overcome this episode after about a year or two. I had slowly started to get ‚Äúback on track‚Äù. I started with my hygiene, then with my school grades. Fast forward a few years of being an A+ student and I am realizing that my depression has never left me. I am an agnostic and I often contemplate things when I am bored (which is a lot). I have been getting the symptoms I had at the very start, boredom and a sort of restless-tiredness. On the weekends I sleep 15 hrs or so, I find something to do and get bored in 15 minutes. Everything in my life seems like a boring chore that never ends, like a grind for nothing.
Sometimes I feel happy, but then I realize how stupid it all is. I cant stop thinking about how nothing matters and everything I do is meaningless. I wonder what I‚Äôm even still here for. I don‚Äôt have anyone I care about enough to keep living, I don‚Äôt have anything that seems worth waking up and doing all the tedious chores of my life. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is the fear of messing up, and if the next plane of existence is worse than this one. And now any form of help is useless because in the back of my head I know being ‚Äúmentally heathy‚Äù is another way of saying distracted and oblivious to the truth and reality."
863,depression,I don‚Äôt know how to do this,"I‚Äôve never made a post before. 

Idk how to do this. Idk how to do anything really. I feel like I‚Äôm stumbling through life for no reason. You know how people ask ‚Äúwhat would you tell your younger self‚Äù I‚Äôd say just fucking do it. You know what I mean. JUST FUCKING DO IT. Spare everyone the trouble. It doesn‚Äôt get better. You keep hurting everyone around you. No one really wants you. They may act like they do sometimes but they make it apparent that they don‚Äôt really. they‚Äôd be so much better without you. It would all be so much better if you didn‚Äôt be in the first place. Never there to bother anyone. You just fuck everything up. You think hey this is actually going okay but oh wait no it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs just as bad as it ever was even worse actually because you made everyone think you were okay and then you pulled this stupid shit and made everyone hate you because you hate yourself and you want to not exist. You don‚Äôt wanna die necessarily. You want to have not been. You want to go back and make it possible that you weren‚Äôt even a thought. But that‚Äôs not possible. So just go back and end it before you met anyone in your current life. Yeah your parents might think of you and hurt a little bit but let‚Äôs be honest they‚Äôre gonna forget you existed they never cared anyway you weren‚Äôt the favorite or even the preferred. Didn‚Äôt matter how hard you tried. Where did that get you? Nowhere. Absolutely nowhere. You fucking failure. JUST DO IT. Just disappear. Everyone will move on. You aren‚Äôt a significant mark in any ones life."

865,depression,My therapist and other friends of the past thinks my parents caused my mental issues. I'm not sure though. What should I do?,"The reason I'm asking this is because I don't know if I believe them. Ive had depression for the last 7 years and since I'm 25 going on 26 that's basically my entire adult life so far. But mostly all my life I've dealt with anxiety, super lower confidence, extreme lack of social skills to the point where I can't connect with people and sometimes just general anti social behavior from what I've been told. 

It's ruined my life in everyway possible. But my therapist and friends say that my parents have basically messed me up mentally and emotionally. I would like to not say so because I am an adult and a guy so I should be able to be mentally strong enough to move on no matter what. 

Because in my opinion my parents did a lot for me. I always had food. And they made sure I had clothes etc. There were a few downsides as my parents were protective so they didn't allow me to stay the night at my friends until I was a nearly a senior in high school. I also had a curfew at 8pm as well then which only was lifted after I graduated high school.

My parents pushed me to be great at everything. Including my looks as they would point out any flaw I had throughput the day like teeth not being super white or hair messy or didn't smell amazing even in public. Sports was big too. Even though after I stopped most of my family just called me a waste of size or they called me a bad return on investment.

And even as an adult they don't want me getting a job with a white population too large as they think I'll get hurt because I'm in a minority group. 

There's more to it but I don't think these things should have large impact into my adult life. And I think it's my fault that I'm not mentally stronger and fell into a 7 years major depression disorder that anti depressants can't even fix.  

Idk what to think anymore..do they have a point or am I just weak?"

ill never forget how my mom shouted and slapped me saying me and my sister now have to work side jobs to raise money for an abortion and i agreed.
I know I have to have an abortion because my parents cannot afford to raise another child. my dad lost his job because covid here in the philippines is so bad.
some of my friends gave me some money for the abortion and i love them so much but its just not enough. abortion in the philippines is illegal so the clinic im going to is asking alot.

ive been calling the guy who got me pregnant to atleast help in paying the clinic but hes blocked me on all social media accounts. im so stupid and feel so angry towards myself for letting this happen. ive been having random break downs in my room and im always panicking and dont know what to do. im also scared to have an abortion because ive never done it.

5 days go by, it's friday evening, I'm relieved that the week is over, promise I'll work during the week end... saturday I stress about sunday and all the work I have to do, sunday goes by and nothing happened. I just know I'll have to go through another week. 
And in this situation I just want to end it all. Always finding a new way to die on my way to school.

My bf has been so supportive, but I‚Äôm worried he‚Äôs starting to resent me for this depressive episode.

It isn‚Äôt, I just don‚Äôt know how to move forward and he‚Äôs a comforting presence.

I haven‚Äôt been this bad since 2014, long before I met him. The last time I felt this low, I was selfish and put my family through two suicide attempts. I sometimes wish I‚Äôd succeeded but no, I just put my parents in debt given I was a minor at the time. I was shipped off to wilderness therapy and picked up some great coping skills in the 3.5 months I spent cut off from the world in the desert.

Please someone tell me this is normal and that things will get back to the way they were soon. I really need help now because of this. Most of all I can‚Äôt ruin what I‚Äôve started with this girl. It‚Äôll kill me."

878,depression,Depression not only hurts me,"It also hurts my parents. They have always been very supportive but they have no idea what to do to help me.
It makes me feel even worse.

Yesterday I told them I wanted to resign on my job because I couldn't make it anymore. My bosses and co-workers definitely disrespect me. Many people can cope with such aggression at work but I just can't.
They are super worried, they are afraid that I will never be able to work and have a normal stable life with a good job, a wife and kids.

All my parents want is to see me happy but ever since I entered high-school, things have gotten worse and worse.

I managed to build a new social circle almost from scratch after college (because for some reason, people I believed to be my friends in college stopped communicating with me afterwards, even though I've tried to keep in touch with them). But I realized that all these new people I met aren't true friends.
I can't open up to them about anything serious. 
I'm also still single. Never had a girlfriend or whatever (I'm 27).
This is probably the thing that hurts me the most. Knowing that no one will ever love me because I'm basically un-lovable.
The only exception are my parents and yet I keep disappointing them all the time.

I wanted to end it all but my parents would probably die too if I killed myself. Well, I'm pretty sure that my depression already shortened their life expectancy. It's terrible because I'm basically slowly killing the only people who really care about me.

Sorry, it might be very confused, I didn't really know where I was going with this post... Just needed to writer these things apparently."
879,depression,"I have trash (not biohazard trash) literally sitting on the floor and don't even use a bag that's 1cm away to put the rest of the trash in, someone observed that I probably have depression because they used to live like that too. How correct might that be?","I mean I've been diagnosed but the diagnosis was literally ""Let's say you have it so I can prescribe you meds for an off-label use""."
880,depression,I'm so tired I just want to fall asleep and sleep for a long time,"I guess I have depression and I think I had it most of my 20s and I think as years go by it just gets harder problems get harder energy goes down even more and then you get close to 30 and start dealing with all the feelings that go along with that milestone. And then I had a pet loss like 6 months ago and that was the worst and I realized that when she was alive how the fuck could I be sad at least I had her. Depression ruins everything you always focus on what's missing and feel miserable

I'm so freaking tired My parents are hopeful for me to find a job and career but feeling motivated is so freaking hard and I think being alone for years with no friends and never having had a boyfriend also saps motivation. I wish I was married by now with a man who takes care of me and loves me. I feel like that would be energizing and solve my problems. But I never felt good enough or pretty enough"
881,depression,I wish I could go back to being happy,You a good while now I've just felt sad and shitty I cry and do nothing basically everyday. Sucide seems like a great alternative at this point.
882,depression,Getting better intimidates me,"I know what steps I need to take first. It just seems so fucking scary, knowing that at any time I can get worse again. Staying at rock bottom isn't as bad as falling back down. It's the feeling of knowing that you're getting worse... knowing that everything you worked for is gonna be thrown away. Getting better feels just as hard as suicide, which is why I'm afraid. I just don't want to end up at square one again. I guess I find comfort in knowing I can't get worse (jk it always gets worse)"
883,depression,I'm so irritated with people misunderstanding psychopaths as mass murderers and monsters,"We are judged for being aware of the weaknesses of empathy and simply being more logical most of the time. It doesn't offend me or anything, since I'm pretty much not able to get offended, but it's just simply annoying and the amount of misconceptions about psychopaths is insane."
884,depression,what now,"i don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, i feel like i know these other people who have chronic depression but they have coping habits, healthy or not whether it be self injurious behaviors or drugs or co dependence or anything. and i‚Äôm just to a point where that doesn‚Äôt fix it i can never ever get better. i am alone whether or not i‚Äôm fucking related to. it‚Äôs not about oh ‚Äúyou‚Äôre loved‚Äù or anything nothing helps. i‚Äòbe tried everything healthy or not therapists, meds, anything and i just feel like what the fucking point anymore. i‚Äôm just a kid i don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening i don‚Äôt know who i am or where i wanna be and i wish i could just be normal and fix it and anything. i cannot believe this is glorified. i‚Äôm am in the agony i created for myself. i am my own fucking demise. i just need to know what‚Äôs next because i‚Äôm at such a huge loss of what to do anymore."
885,depression,I don't get it...,I don't get it. I met the love of my life and felt we were so compatible. He felt the same way. I became depressed because of the many things in my life I couldn't handle. I almost killed myself and didn't tell him because of the many things he was dealing with. I also am afraid he would have left me because people have left me before due to my depression. I broke up with him in a weird way because I needed time to heal and didn't want him to suffer in the relationship. It would have taken a toll on him. He can't forgive me because I wasn't honest with him and lost trust in me and no longer thinks we were compatible. My depression ruins everything.

888,depression,having a career crisis rn and idk what to do anymore,"im 20 and a first year college. Ive always been in love with the arts and I draw, take pictures, and do music production. 

 I took Multimedia Arts in college so I can explore more other artforms but Ive always wanted to take music production bcos ive been very very into music and thats one thing that makes me stand out.  But i didnt take music production because i dont want my creativity to be limited and not be insecure with the fundamentals of it ++ tuition is very expensive. 

bcos ive been so into music, I lost my adrenaline with drawing. I can still draw but I just dont have that crave of sketching anymore, it feels more like an household chore. it's one of the reasons why i took MMA cos I might just get that spark back.  I also took MMA so I can earn money and save up for music gears for my artist career. Ive always wanted to play on stage and go touring w a band or record in my solo act. MMA is literally just a Plan B bcos who knows I might not sell with music. 

I'm already getting torn with studying MMA though. That one semester is very creatively draining and exhausting. I'm starting to not like taking pictures (bcos I do film photography, I dont have a DSLR yet bcos it's expensive and unfortunately, film is also getting expensive so that leaves me burned out and broke).  

And then all of my music mutuals are releasing their albums, eps, new singles. My 3 songs in spotify are like back in 2019 and the other one is just last year. I've been trying to build just one ep and I still havent finished it. I'm getting insecure and jealous whenever I see my friends performing and doing gigs. I feel very useless and like I cant do anything. 

 I'm starting to think of training as a barista, but tuition is also expensive and I really want to do it. I might have to stop for a year in college, but in order not to disappoint my family, I must do well in my training and get a job so I can at least be financially stable. 

 But these days, I'm trying to practice latte art during 2nd semester (I havent gone to my classes completely bcos of my burn out and it's rlly getting out of hand), I keep failing my latte arts, i dont know what Im doing wrong and it's been a week of coffee and latter art researching and practice and I just couldnt get it. I just want to be prepared and have that stable hand motion when pouring milk to the coffee for latte art and I just cant. 

 Meanwhile, my non binary boyfriend in Ireland (we're 11,240km apart), is just a bit younger than me but they already have a job and is very mature already. I cant really talk to them right now with what Im feeling because it's either theyre asleep or theyre at work and that leaves me feeling lonely. I cant really sleep thru it bcos I have a very very bad sleep sched so everyone's asleep and Im just up in the middle of the night with fuzz in my head. All I got is insomnia and oversleeps.  

I am in a very very lost place right now. I don't know what to do at all, I'm having a hard time functioning day by day, I'm overwhelmed. 

I feel dumb, useless, and comparable. and im broke too ;((  I thought I had my life planned but idk what to do at all to organize. I cant seem to look forward anymore.   
   
p.s. I don't think im capable of receiving phrases like ""oh im sorry. i hope you can find your path soon"" something like that, bcos honestly it's very hard for me to imagine my future. I would love to read similar stories from u guys tho!! id also appreciate practical tips or mind changing ones if u guys know something!!"

890,depression,I‚Äôve resorted to coming here..,"I‚Ä¶ idk what to say. Idk how this works. I don‚Äôt use Reddit often. I‚Äôd just rather not be insulted or anything rn. I‚Äôm an 18 year old guy who is currently having a mental breakdown. I have hereditary depression, which is a real thing, but I don‚Äôt often have breakdowns. But I‚Äôve been experiencing extreme sadness and depression for a while now. However, I‚Äôve been bottling up everything. I‚Äôm too much of a coward to actually ask for help or confide in someone. My cousin is also having bad depression, so I‚Äôve been trying to be strong for him. But it‚Äôs getting too hard. My brain is torturing me with people from my past. It‚Äôs some real petty shit that is causing me all this pain. But idk what to do. I don‚Äôt want to die, but at the same time, I just want all of this shit to end. I won‚Äôt kill myself though for the sole reason of my family finding my lifeless body. I can‚Äôt bare to imagine their reactions. But then sometimes I do just wanna stop all this mental pain. For a while now, I‚Äôve been putting all my pain into writing. And every single day, I just try to distract myself from the pain. But it doesn‚Äôt always work. I‚Äôm at a point in my life where I feel like I self sabotaged too much. I‚Äôm lonely as fuck. I have like no friends because I dropped them all years ago. I also have Asperger‚Äôs syndrome, which really doesn‚Äôt help. That and my social anxiety. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I feel so trapped.

891,depression,Don't know what to do anymore.,"21 (M)

Recently went to a psychiatrist because of a panic attack at work and was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder and was told by the doctor to resign from work as it might make things worse down the road (working at a call center). 

I just feel so weak right now, like I'm unconsciously faking things just to get out of a hard time. I have some savings to work with while I'm unemployed. Everything just feels so complicated and it feels like my meds and consultations with my psychiatrist will bleed the small amount of money I've saved up dry, I really just want to end it all. I don't deserve to live being this pathetic."
892,depression,Please help me.,"**tw: suicide**

I don't know how to start this. My head feels like it's going to explode, I'm shaking from both anger and hurt, and everything in the world seems incredibly shitty. I feel terrible and the only thing on my mind is that I want to end my life. I'm obviously not going to do it -- I'm safe. Just in the wrong headspace.

I had a situation/argument with a friend as soon as I woke up. 50 messages from her side, though not saying any one of us were entirely in the wrong. Loads of miscommunication, arguments, saying I'm ""attacking"" her friends and her blah blah you get the point. I was slightly petty in the beginning too but tried my best to communicate. After whatever happened at the end, I felt like an absolute cunt. A shitty person and a shitty friend even though I tried my best to put forth what was bothering me. Ended up feeling so so miserable ad a weight on my chest as soon as I woke up.

An hour later, as I type this, I had an AWFUL argument full of yelling and screaming with my mother. Keep in mind my relationship with my mother has always been unstable -- again, not anyone's fault. Just normal mommy issues and loads of miscommunication even though I've tried my best to forgive and understand her side lmao. But after every, and this argument too, I ALWAYS feel like THE person who is at fault. Makes me realize that I shouldn't have brought this xyz thing up or mentioned the one thing that bothered me because people find it so SO easy to throw it back into my face. I'm obviously a sensitive person, and every time, EVERY fucking time I try to communicate, I'm the person at fault. Not just with my mother, but with this friend today too, I'm the shitty person. I'm the bad friend. I'm a bad person. I'm a bad daughter. 

As my mom argued, she claimed that no matter how good daughters are -- some part of them will always be jealous of their mother, aka me. This made me very sad and VERY angry. I love my mother with all my heart, and yes we have our differences, but I've never EVER thought of her this way. I've tried my best and I occasionally do get very loud and angry and say the wrong things, but so does she. Anyway, she claimed I'm jealous of her because I told my dad that she has a habit of always wanting to be right -- which is again, the way i view her. She got angry at that and said I'm always trying to turn my dad against her which is insane talk. She's always trying to make me feel very fucking excluded from my OWN family (her, my dad, and my older brother) every time I try to take part in a conversation. She says I have no right to comment anything about her to my dad or my brother because I only have a negative perception of her. When I was younger, any time I'd try to make a joke with my older brother -- she'd cut me off and make things more strained than it needs to be between my brother and I. I like to think this is half the reason my brother and I stopped speaking from a very young age. We barely talk now and when we do, it's all very formal/small talk.

This brings me to my last point -- my life has a funny way of always making me feel excluded from things. I'm the person that's left out, discarded, projected on, a fucking movie villain in everyone's lives. I can't make a joke with my brother because everything is my fault and apologize to your brother because he's sensitive and doesn't open up easily while you're loud and can talk about your feelings so obviously your brother is suffering more than you are! Your feelings don't matter because occasionally people hear you! (No one does. But my mother likes to think so.)

I can't remember the last time anyone else was as interested in my life and I as I am with other people, nor can I recall when someone gave a shit about my feelings. I'm not a boring person by any means, but people just never want to get to know me the way I do with them. With certain friends, with my own fucking family, etc. It's always there. I'm the background character that loves to get to know people and involve myself, but gets absolutely shat on every time they try. A life like this and constant situations like these always perpetuate the idea in my head that I'm truly better without anyone in my life. No one is ever interested in me or cares for me and I'm all alone."

894,depression,It‚Äôs so taboo that no one thinks I‚Äôm serious.,"I‚Äôm sinking deeper everyday, but I don‚Äôt expect much support from people around me since depression itself is seen as taboo in my family. I‚Äôm sure they know but just don‚Äôt see it as a problem.
Honestly, I just need a helping hand so that I can do something again, studying an online course/uni again, getting a job, making friends again, dating.
Doing everything for yourself since your  mid teens makes you forget to occasionally ask for help and now no one around me really expects me to do that. There‚Äôs just too much weight I‚Äôm carrying.
I had a lot of terrible stuff happen to me leading up to me having to leave med school and then being where I‚Äôm at now and I swear whatever I do just isn‚Äôt enough to get myself out. 
When there are good days, I don‚Äôt even think I deserve those few moments of happiness since I‚Äôm really only ignoring my reality. It‚Äôs always distracting me
I want to accomplish something without losing any more years from my life but I can‚Äôt even bring myself to go outside.
And it‚Äôs slowly becoming: can‚Äôt clean, can‚Äôt cook, can‚Äôt leave my room.

I‚Äôm failing life, and just feel like I‚Äôm not cut out for living. What the point in trying anymore? I‚Äôve got no interests and I feel like I‚Äôm going nowhere. Pretty much everyday I think about killings myself, how is do it and what I‚Äôd leave behind for people to find after. Why do I want to have a big scar across my chest or arms. I don‚Äôt think suicide is a likely option for me as I‚Äôm just too much of a coward to go through with it. But the self-harm is very likely at the moment. I just don‚Äôt understand, when I think of life I think its beautiful but I can‚Äôt see where I fit in. I don‚Äôt see a point to me living because I feel like a burden to everyone around me. I‚Äôve realised recently that life is very short so why even try to make something of myself. I have no interests and I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

902,depression,I don‚Äôt know how to feel normal anymore,"I usually post on an alt but I forgot the password whoops. 

A few months ago I cold turkeyed my meds thinking I didn‚Äôt need them anymore, which caused me to spiral a bit, and then start taking them again. What I‚Äôve ended up realizing is that either way I don‚Äôt feel okay. Either I feel down, hopeless and alone. or I feel completely numb to emotions, the world dulled completely by my SSRIs. I wish I could just return to being *normal* to not having to drug myself to not feel bleak everyday. Therapy has helped but it isn‚Äôt the answer, I don‚Äôt know what is. 

Even with my meds and my friends I feel isolated all the time, I feel unloved and unappreciated. What sucks is I know my friends care about me but I continuously push them away, either actively or by accident. It feels like eventually it‚Äôll just be me and my dog. 

Things have been getting progressively worse over the years, more and more things escalate to a point where it becomes unbearable. Im not suicidal, but I also don‚Äôt know how much worse I can feel before it reaches a critical mass.

906,depression,"i fucked up so bad now i fell into a great depression to the point i cant eat or sleep (PLEASE READ) i need guidance, advice, anything, prayer?"," Okay background: I'm 20, I had a sheltered and isolating upbringing, I never did something like runaway before, I ran away from home with my uncle and cousins, everything went well, for the first time ever, I was happy as shit, did things I never did before, socialized, etc, my mom called A LOT and I wanted to be respectful, so I always answered. (this is where I fucked up tbh) some weeks passed, and after my grandma and mom spent days begging me to come back, I made the choice to come back home, for a multitude of stupid reasons, I believed i was emotionally manipulated into doing it, i didn't think of all the traumatic things my parents done to me, i was focused on the anxiety i was having from the stuff my family told me would happen if i stayed, (I know it doesn't make sense for me to come back its like I was under a spell or something) and when I made the choice, I forgot how controlling my parents were, I wasn't thinking about why I left in the first place, its like I was brainwashed, they promised to help me get a place, job, etc, and that i could stay with my grandma (which didn't end up happening) (I wasn't thinking at all i feel incredibly stupid), my parents were fear mongering and telling me how if I stayed with my uncle bad things would happen, **(which triggered my anxiety and I felt like I was on edge the whole time I was there)** (I was also sick with covid at the time and and they claimed I would get worse if I didn't come back home) and that I was being used by my uncle for money, (because I get a disability check) which I later found out not to be true, I had an honest talk with them (my uncle and the rest) after coming back home, they told me they never cared about the money and i could tell they was mad at me for believing this, because they been nothing but good to me, so i'm not too sure why i let my family trick me into believing i was being used... i feel like maybe it's because i'm not use to be treated like a decent human being maybe? and believing i was being used was how i made sense of it? i don't know i'm fucking stupid. **once i came back home, i started to fall into a deep depression and regret and shame, and embarrassment, I started remembering things from the past like the time my mom made me eat food she spit up as a punishment, she claimed i was being ""disrespectful"" I was like 12 or something at the time, another time they whooped me, stripped me naked, turned r&amp;b music on while whooping me, another time, made me stand in corner, while holding a squat, growing up my dad always did things to purposely make me mad, my dad made weird faces, laughed in my face while crying, and got pleasure from it saying things like yes! yes! and the more i would get worked up, the more he mocked me, they would call me weird, slap me in face, check my phone and criticize things i said to people, rip up songs i made, claiming they were too depressing, and made jokes about it, most of these things happened when i was 14, it gotten ""better"" as years passed by so sometimes i believed i was being dramatic and that i was never actually abused (i self gaslighted myself a lot)(I think this is also how they was able to convince me to come back) I tried to forget that these things ever happened, but when i came back home, it hit me with full force. along with the regret of coming back.** now that i'm back, they haven't done anything bad to me, BUT now that these memories resurfaced, I feel this intense hatred, towards them, and I honestly want them out of my life for good, but I cant now, and to make it worse, I reached out to my uncle and cousins begging for a second chance, and how I screwed up, and they said ""your parents were sending a lot of disrespectful stuff to our phone and it put us through a lot of stress, and we feel like we picked you up for nothing, so its out of our hands not much we can do to help you now"" (which I totally understand I didn't think about the stress i was putting them through) But it hurts knowing that the only people that's capable of helping me, cant help me anymore, and i feel like it's my fault because I was the one who ultimately made the choice to come back and i feel incredibly stupid, I feel crippled with regret so much to the point i barely eat and sleep. because i had one shot to change my life for the better and i fucked it up for myself. and I don't think they sympathize with me because their like ""you the one that decided to come back"" not your mom, not your dad, YOU and it just makes me feel so fucking stupid. because I really didn't think this through. and suicide feels like the only way out of these thoughts, shame ,etc. LIKE I WAS LITERALLY FREEEEE and I came back home, i know there is probably many people here who wish they had the opportunity I had, I feel like I deserve to die for doing something so stupid. I just can't live with myself after doing this. i don't know what to do now, each day here feels like hell and i get really emotional around them so i distance myself and stay in my room.

916,depression,Depression ruined my life,"I (19f) have been depressed since the age of 8 and I can't seem to get my life in order. 

It's a severe self hatred that's starting to show physical symptoms. Several of my teeth are falling out because I lost motivation to get out of bed to brush them. I'm still working on my GED because I dropped out. Since I don't go anywhere I've lost all of my friends. 
I got into a relationship last year and it quickly turned physically abusive but I was hoping that he would kill me.

 No medication ever seemed to help so I used pot to self medicate. All of these things that I've done to myself just makes me think I'm damaged beyond repair."

I'm still on the way to loving myself more.
919,depression,My house is disgusting,"Hello, I‚Äôm a (31F) In the throes of a bad depressive episode. I also have ADHD and CPTSD, due to some issues with my job I have been off work for two months now and in that time I have done absolutely nothing. My dishes have gotten so bad that I occasionally just throw things away that look like they can‚Äôt be saved. About once a week I will go around my house and gather up all the trash and throw it out and bag up dirty laundry that my cats of peed on after I clean up their litter box. I know that my environment is making my depression worse I can‚Äôt seem to move. I keep trying to set up counseling in to see somebody but everybody is full or they don‚Äôt specialize in trauma. I was sober but I relapsed and that‚Äôs definitely contributing to how I feel. I stopped being able to socialize, anytime around people I just fight or shut down. I ran up about five grand on a credit card just to feel better for a moment, and I‚Äôm desperately just trying to find relief in dating apps and attention I immediately regret and delete. 

How do I break this? How do I get out of this? I‚Äôm terrified of going back to work because I don‚Äôt remember the last time I spent 10 hours on my feet. Before December sometime. I‚Äôm just laying here and binge eating, pushing people away and isolating. I can‚Äôt seem to stop. I‚Äôve even taken prescription stimulants that are prescribed to me, and they just make my heart race but I‚Äôm still paralyzed. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I hate myself like this."
920,depression,That depression high period,"You know how they say every once in a great while you deal with that random period of time where your mood completely changes for a few hours to a week? That period of time literally just started like an hour ago. It feels so good. I got sucked into another depressive spell but this one was really severe and started to think/plan my suicide. All of a sudden, I just felt really‚Ä¶good? I just feel like I could run away and never come back. I feel so powerful and have so much energy. Has anyone else had this random burst of a complete mood change?"

922,depression,putting effort into friendships feels pointless,"I have a problem of isolating myself. i don‚Äôt usually ask people to hang out, it feels like a chore. i don‚Äôt want to be one on one with people, it feels like there‚Äôs so much pressure and i don‚Äôt want to feel rejected like i‚Äôve felt since probably early high school. early high school is really when I started to isolate myself and not put forth the effort into other people.

however, when i DO put effort, it never feels reciprocated and it hurts. it hurts to feel left out by people, like they think you‚Äôre annoying or that they don‚Äôt like you for whatever reason. it‚Äôs scary. i never feel like the first choice for anyone, and i haven‚Äôt felt that way since MIDDLE school (I‚Äôm 22 now!!!). the last time i had a best friend who i genuinely enjoyed being around and didn‚Äôt worry about feeling judged was in middle school. that‚Äôs so sad to me. 

it just feels like putting all this effort in is pointless when i‚Äôm never going to be enough for anyone anyway. it genuinely is not fun to hang out with someone for me one on one. and i know it‚Äôs because i‚Äôm subconsciously fearing judgment and abandonment. but for some reason, I‚Äôm more willing to put the effort in for romantic relationships and it feels more fun. maybe because i feel a sense of validation more easily."

Before covid i could manage my thoughts because i was hardly alone with myself, i was happier then- but not happy. Now years into covid, im not the same. Im so unhappy most days and struggle to find the things i used to love doing amusing anymore. Ive seen this change in myself and its made my self confidence really low, i hate who i am and yet im stuck, i cant get out of this hell. To make matters extremely worse, my boyfriend of around 8 months has noticed the change, and can no longer love who i am/ becoming. This makes it harder to love myself as im never enough, my happiest self never stays as recovery isnt linear and the people i meet during my highs never stay for the lows. All of me is a joke, no one will love who i am at both stages, my highest and my lowest. Im so fucking sad as Ive pushed away someone I care about the most in this world. I have no idea what to do."

My mom knows I go to therapy but never asks me how I‚Äôm doing about anything 
My family and just being around them stresses me out so much
I can‚Äôt take this anymore I‚Äôm so tired

I‚Äôm tired but I can‚Äôt take the time to rest 
Because my depression controls everything I do

Also another thing that has been seriously bothering me, is my ex changed me to become who I once was a partier looking for a good time. She used to be the one with her shit together. Though we switched. I got family, but as far as anything else goes I'm all alone. And I'm stuck in a endless work sleep cycle. I'm just done with it. I'm not gonna do anything, but I've been in such a horrible head space. Between the breakup and my friends either being moved away or expecting. I'm just all alone in life.

937,depression,"How to help a withdrawn (introverted, depressed) friend?","Someone I‚Äôm close to (in fact, he‚Äôs called me his best friend before) has just started falling off recently. I know he has a history of depression and has somewhat recently started meds, but he also hasn‚Äôt been the same since starting the meds. He‚Äôs been forgetful and checked out. He‚Äôs also been bailing on our plans. I recently asked him what was going on and he just said that he needed space and doesn‚Äôt have capacity to talk about anything that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúemotional or deep.‚Äù I asked him what that meant and he just said that he doesn‚Äôt want to talk in general and that he‚Äôs working through some stuff that has nothing to do with me. The thing is, he‚Äôs done this to me 6-7 times in the past year and I‚Äôve always checked in from afar (like sending him food and telling him he‚Äôs not obligated to respond), but it‚Äôs never been this bad. I haven‚Äôt spoken to him in around two weeks and I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve ever gone this long without speaking. Right before ghosting me, he randomly dropped off food that his mom made. 

I don‚Äôt want to burden him with my life, but I‚Äôm also going through serious health struggles. We‚Äôre in the same graduate program and he doesn‚Äôt seem to have noticed that I haven‚Äôt been at school because I have been placed on bed rest. I have multiple surgeries coming up next month and I miss my friend. In the past, he has expressed shame and regret for not being a very attentive friend, but this version of him is next level. He will forget something that I texted him maybe 10 texts ago. 

I know that he‚Äôs introverted and gets drained easily, so I don‚Äôt want to check in and have our relationship feel like a chore to him. I also don‚Äôt know if his depressed brain would feel abandoned if I just continued to give him space. I also don‚Äôt want him to feel shame in re-establishing contact with me, especially since I will have gone through a lot of traumatic medical procedures while he is checked out. But at the same time, I don‚Äôt want to tell him what‚Äôs going on right now since he explicitly set the boundary with me regarding his lack of capacity to care for our friendship right now. 

At the end of the day, I refuse to lose our friendship to this mental illness. I know I need to be the strong one and create an environment that doesn‚Äôt fuel existing shame. Does anyone have any advice for me? Additionally, I‚Äôm not sure how to navigate this request for space from someone with clear abandonment issues. I don‚Äôt want to affirm his belief that people cannot be trusted, but I also feel uneasy about checking in constantly when he is pushing me away. Is it just that I need to be stronger and continue to check in and divorce myself from his response? Introverted folks who struggle with depression: do you actually want to be left alone? Or will it make you feel abandoned and uncared for? What type of cadence of communication makes you feel cared for without draining you?

TLDR; introverted depressed friend is pulling away and I want to make him feel cared for while giving him space at the same time."
938,depression,I suffer from depression and I dont know how to tell my friends,I have been suffering from depression for years now I‚Äôm not sure when. It comes and goes and I like to think I have it under control. But I dont. I find myself losing myself when I am going through a depressive episode they get really bad. I am not a very vulnerable person and tend to keep things to myself. But i know my depression gets in the way of friendships and my past and current relationships. How do I tell those close to me I suffer from depression. And how do I keep them from pitying me that I do ? I dont want to be pathetic or seem like I‚Äôm asking for help I just want them to know thats the reason for some of my actions

But even then I'm at a point where I can numb myself enough to not feel most of it and act like everything is ok enough, that it's gonna get better. Maybe it will maybe it won't, idk, but regardless I'm not being honest with myself. I'm not ok at all. I have been in so much pain for so long, and yeah sometimes it got better, and it probably will get better again soon, but it never lasts long. It always gets worse again and each time it does it gets worse and worse and worse. I am a shell of my former self. I hate myself and I hate how much I hate and pity myself but I don't know what else to think. I am falling apart and can barely stay composed throughout the day. I can'barely even get out of bed in the mornings and the only reason I do is because I don't have a choice. I have ruined so many good relationships I had with people and I will continue doing that. I have been on the verge of suicide for months now and nit a single people other than myself knows. I am in so much pain and I want it to end."

941,depression,Always used and then thrown away,"About 4 months ago I met someone through an online dating app and we connected so deeply on an emotional and intellectual level. I havent felt so immediately comfortable and safe and like I belonged with someone since I met my best friend 10 years ago. 

We were both going through a tough time and didn't want to be official, but found comfort in spending our time together just laying in bed holding each other and being there for each other. We had sex a few times, but that didnt even matter that much, it was the closeness and affection and connection that I had never felt before that really filled me with joy. For the first time in a physical relationship, I felt cared for and like my needs were finally being met in a way they never had been in the past. 

He promised me that he would never hurt me like others have in the past, that he would be honest and open with me. 

And then last week, he told me he was struggling to figure out if he could love someone romantically, and that he wanted to talk to me about our relationship and where we stand. I was working over the weekend, so he said we'd talk on Monday, but he bailed last minute saying he was really exhausted and couldn't have a really serious talk and we'd talk on Thursday. 

Today, I messaged him and he suddenly told me that he got back together with his ex-girlfriend on Sunday and that he understands if I never want to speak to him again, but he still wants to be there to support me and be my friend. I cried, I called him some choice words, he said he deserved it. I told him I needed to think about everything.

After talking with a friend, I decided that this wasn't worth losing his friendship when I dont often feel understood or like I belong. I told him that I was willing to be friends but that it would take some time for me to be able to open up to him and trust him again but if he was willing to prove he can be a good friend and gain that trust, I was willing to try. 

He did an immediate 180 and told me he's thought about it and we can't be friends because he will always feel so guilty that he broke that promise that he wouldn't fuck me over like the others did. 

I really thought this was different. I really thought that he cared about me as a person and not just for sex. But, it's just like it always is, used up and then thrown away. 

I was finally starting to feel like the dark cloud hanging over me was clearing up every once in a while. I felt true joy for the first time in years. I finally felt like I was good enough and like I was making progress. I finally started to feel some small amount of love for myself. And now I feel like I'm drowning and can't catch my breath, I feel small and insignificant, I feel unlovable."

943,depression,Depression From Helping Coworker,"So I told my coworker about my anxiety and depression. They mentioned how they go through it as well. Even before that we instantly connected and this just made me feel even closer to them. Unfortunately, I have a soft spot for them now that anything they need, I cant say no. At this point I've been working 10 to 12 hour days to cover for them as I'm too the point that I'm doing their work. I really can't say no and I even encourage it. I tell them how I got them always and I want to, but it's so draining on me. It's actually starting to frustrate me and I've been having anxiety from all the tasks piling up and getting home I just want to cry. I can't stop wanting to be there for this person and help them as much as I can, but it's really messing with me. I'm not sure how to say no and I can't seem to tell them the toll it's taking on me."

946,depression,No Trust,"It's exhausting not being able to trust.

Having been severely bullied, having been abandoned by whole friend groups, having been cheated on in a serious relationship.  It takes a LOT of convincing for me to open up.  Whether that's sharing personal and vulnerable things with friends, or committing myself fully to a relationship without doubts that I would be better off single.  My anxiety throws in intrusive thoughts all the time.  I really just prefer not to talk about myself.  People think it's so weird as if all I can do is have small talk, but it's not that.  I am happy to talk about all kinds of complex and serious topics, or to explore other people's history, but there's a serious block pushing me to avoid talking about my personal issues or feelings.  

It's exhausting being on guard and preparing to be on defense all the time rather than being able to just let me mind rest in the comfort and continuity of trusting the current state of things, and my current company."

So I am asking how to I try to get better? What do I do? I don't have any friends, I have parents in a different country but I am not comfortable with reaching out to them because they were very abusive. So what can I do to be normal? How do I become productive even with this my shit mental? I just need so directions or something. I am so fuck sacred that I will always feel this sad. I need a way out."

Recently I made friends with a colleague and we started texting quite frequently. In the beginning it was quite normal but as we eased into the friendship, I started getting a feeling that they are in depression or were in depression at a certain time. They joke about suicide and depression and stuff like that but never told anything explicitly. 

Our chats don't have much and they always kinda give one word responses and whatnot. I understand it might be that they are just busy or something. But since quite some days she is feeling a bit low. 

Now, as a friend what are some things I can do? We live in different cities so it's pretty much just texting back &amp; forth. I check on them from time to time, send memes &amp; wholesome stuff.. but just wanna know if there's anything else I can do in case they actually have/had depression. 

PS: I know I might be looking too much into the lines, extrapolating unnecessary conclusions and all but I didn't want to take a risk when it comes to this and I just wanna help out a mate!

Thank you for reading,
Cheers."

954,depression,How am I supposed to get better?,"I swear sometimes it feels like over the last decade of seeing psychs I have been diagnosed and tested for just about everything in the book as much fun as it is to know how many lovely little labels I have I'm still fucked (i don't know if I can swear in here I assume I can but I also get kids might be in here so I'm so sorry kids). Now I'm an adult, working full-time, completely unfulfilled, and can't afford to spend $100 a week so that a person sitting on the other end of a computer can tell me my feelings are valid or that they're sorry I went through x,y, or z. I cannot take another decade of paying through the nose to gain no results. The mantra of ""it gets better"" is so relative. Does it? Does it really? Is coping with the constant mental strain of the pit of loneliness and shame and self-hatred really ""getting better""? Is that a way to live the rest of my life? I shell out like 65% of my salary after taxes on rent because I live in a city so I can have a job and at this point, my options are food or therapy. I just don't know how I'm supposed to get better. I'm clearly venting here and once again I'm sorry I just feel like I'm out of options. It's not like mental illness is curable, it's like having internal herpes - yeah sometimes it flairs up and it's really bad and other times it's just kind of nagging in the back of your head but it's always there. The only difference is that this shit is rotting me from the inside out. I can't tell if I should be screaming or punching or crying or just numb at this point. But hey, my cat likes her new toy so that's something I guess."
955,depression,M19 - I‚Äôm only happy when I‚Äôm high,"I told myself that I‚Äôd stop smoking weed until I was an adult because I‚Äôm not fully developed. But recently I don‚Äôt even care about all that. I don‚Äôt see myself having any kind of future and I‚Äôm unsure about what I want to do with my life. Everyone else seems to be a step above me and I feel like an idiot all the time.

I‚Äôm almost 100% certain I have ADHD. I feel so slow and anxious having to do basic tasks and when I see other people around me completing them so effortlessly, it makes me feel like a complete failure. I want real human connections yet everyone around me feels so artificial.

I feel like I fuck up every social interaction I come into contact with. I‚Äôve tried to work on my social skills for the longest time, but I always feel so slow and clouded. I‚Äôve just began to give up recently and I‚Äôve isolated myself. I sometimes wonder if other people can tell if I‚Äôm depressed.

I wonder if they actually care about me or like me as a person. Why would they though when everything that comes out of my mouth is idiotic even when it feels like I‚Äôm trying my best. I just have such a hard time relating to most people and I feel like I wasn‚Äôt made for this world.

I can‚Äôt stand the idea of going to school and working a job until the day I die when I already feel like I‚Äôm giving up at 19. People tell me that I‚Äôm super smart and that I have so much to live for but I have a hard time believing that. The only choices I have are to face reality and feel depressed or to smoke weed everyday.

Is it really healthy living like this though? I feel like being high gives me a break from reality and makes me much more optimistic about the future, yet once I come down I‚Äôm back to how I felt before.

I cant seem to concentrate in class or doing day to day activites and others around me remark that im bringing the mood down even though I try my hardest to act normal. I think about thoughts of sucicide and death alot but I dont hurt myself so thats why im wondering if im depressed.

964,depression,Lost everything. Literally going insane. Going to die.,"I've lost everything. I'm in a weird purgatory before suicide.
Everyone knows who I am but I have literally no friends. I can't talk to people. Occured to me after nearly two years that everyone in drumline thinks I'm annoying (drumline used to be one of my favorite activities). I found out that pretty much every hangout I've been to since 7th grade I was only invited out of pity by one ""friend"". Everyone there thought I was an annoying and I don't blame them. I never have and never will be in a relationship, I will likely never have friends for the rest of highschool seeing how much I've tried to socialize to no end. I look like a homo erectus so there's that as well. My grades dropped so hard and now my parents stripped away playing instruments which was the last thing that made life bearable. 

I'm living in spectator mode, watching all of the people that I thought were my friends (who actually hate me) move on with their lives, building new relationships, going out and doing things, etc. I used to be a really hyperactive kid because of bad ADHD and now I just wear my hood and sleep in class and not say a single word all day.

I'm so fucking lonely I've been full on talking to myself and having multiple hour conversations with people in my head I've never met. My mind is acting weird it's fucking terrifying. 

Only reason I'm here and not rotting in the earth somewhere is because I haven't found anything to overdose on (powerful sleeping pills would be fantastic). I don't want pain, just wanna go. Other thing I've thought about is just driving down an empty road at 2am with the pedal floored and just waiting until I hit something.

ive lost everything that makes me happy and in so lonely I think I'm going mentally insane and I want to die every minute of my life."
965,depression,"(CW: Suicide talk, brief mention of CSA/abuse) Nearing the end of my rope","This is gonna be another one of those long posts that‚Äôll get maybe five views and two comments, but I don‚Äôt know how much I care. It‚Äôs not like I have many people in real life anyway (especially at 1 in the morning where I am right now), so might as well just put it all out here where someone might see all of it.

I‚Äôm a first-year college student in the U.S. and I just transferred to a new school for this semester because I liked the location more. Dorms were all full when I applied, so I moved into an apartment nearby with a roommate who I don‚Äôt really think likes me all that much. I kinda get the vibe that she‚Äôd prefer to keep things as a ‚Äúpeaceful coexistence‚Äù rather than any sort of friendship.

To put it lightly, making friends has also been rough. I have a couple (read: like four, i counted) people who I knew before, but half of them are in different states and everyone has their own life so it‚Äôs not a perfect solution. I‚Äôm not someone who‚Äôs super confident socially, so when I reach out to try and connect with someone it can be pretty nerve-wracking. Unfortunately, it feels like every time I reach out it just doesn‚Äôt go well or it only lasts a couple of days.

One example of this happened a couple of weeks ago, at my school‚Äôs athletic complex. I was at the climbing wall trying to meet people, and I met this group of three guys who I hung with for the night while we were all there. I was making good conversation and all that, and it felt like it was going super well so I asked for their Snapchats. One of them never added me back, one of them I haven‚Äôt reached out to, and I messaged the last person once and realized this evening that he unfriended me at some point so my message went unread. That stung.

The mountains have really been my happy place since I learned to ski a few seasons ago. There‚Äôs no place like it and, as someone who doesn‚Äôt feel like they belong anywhere, it‚Äôs the closest thing I‚Äôve got to a place I could call home. But enough exposition. Last week I asked a lift operator for her Snapchat and (to my surprise) she gave it to me. However, it got to the point where I felt like I was carrying the conversation because I was initiating everything, she‚Äôd only reply like once or twice a day, and she‚Äôd only follow-up once among other things. So today I ran into her at the resort and waved, and she reacted as I would have to someone I‚Äôd never seen before. At that point I decided to just give up on it, because, while I‚Äôm lonely and therefore more than willing to pull the weight of two in a friendship, the rejection really set in and I couldn‚Äôt make up reasons for why I wasn‚Äôt being appreciated.

Finally, I went to a bar with a friend of mine (someone I knew previously) the other night and I was actually feeling super good when I got there, but that feeling soon faded after it hit me how alone I am and how I feel I don‚Äôt fit in. It‚Äôs like everyone my age who I see has a social circle, and then I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶there.

As a result, I‚Äôm starting to feel discouraged from trying to reach out because it almost never works out and I can save myself the sadness and disappointment. It‚Äôs the same reason why I never post polls or Q&amp;A‚Äôs on social media. Regardless of what I tell myself, trying to engage someone always gets my hopes up that they‚Äôll engage back and I usually end up feeling let down. At this point I‚Äôm probably a few more rejections away from just giving up and isolating myself because it‚Äôs not worth trying.

Things have kind of sucked for as long as I can remember (traumatic childhood, abuse, molestation, family instability) and I‚Äôve been passively suicidal for the past two years straight. It‚Äôs gotten slightly worse at times but tonight I really thought about it. I started drafting the letter and thinking about how I could do it, and I went for a walk to clear my head and (after some nicotine) I still didn‚Äôt feel great, but I didn‚Äôt feel unsafe anymore. I decided to reevaluate my plan of getting drunk because I just didn‚Äôt feel like it (and I have class in the morning anyway) and I didn‚Äôt feel the need to do it anymore, but I‚Äôm really losing here. I feel like there‚Äôs only so much more of this life I can take. I wish I was one of those ‚Äúlone wolf‚Äù types (assuming they exist) who doesn‚Äôt need people, but that‚Äôs not who I am. I don‚Äôt know how much more of this I can take, because everyone tells me ‚Äúit gets better‚Äù and I tried to believe it, but I just can‚Äôt anymore because things have gotten worse or stayed the same for so long. I mean having hope would be nice, but I‚Äôm just running out of things to feel hopeful about. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm really starting to care if things get better, and instead just wanting to be done."

I am following orders and becoming a person other people want me to be. I feel like I am not human to them and they are just faking that they care about me and my problems. Sometimes while laying in bed I felt pity to myself because of the way I act and do stuff. I want to separate myself from the world but on the same time I want the comfort of others.

974,depression,This girl is poison,"My name is Kyle. I'm a 31 year old male virgin skinny and not that bad looking for a tall drink of water and I am absolutely crazy about a girl from work. So much so that she haunts my thoughts daily and has wormed her way into my psyche. 

The girl in question started working at my work last summer and my job being almost exclusively to men it was a nice change of pace. We were separated by shifts at the top me and I worked the night shift, so at the end of the day I would shoot the shit with her for a good 20 to 30 minutes. This became an addiction. It wasn't healthy for me, at this point in my life I have never had a girlfriend so having this interaction with the opposite sex was something of a new thing for me and was at the same time exhilarating. After a few weeks of talking I worked up the courage to give my number, which would never have happened if not for the encouragement of my coworkers. But I did just that.

 And she shot me down, we didn't talk for a week, I think it was due to the awkward exchange but we were cool a week later. At the time I didn't know about the boyfriend. She never once eluded to him. She was very flirty, and with me being the inexperienced welp that I am I fell for it.  It wasn't long after that when she finally casually mentioned the boyfriend and then I decided to stop trying to go for her, obviously cause she was taken and second this was becoming a huge problem on my end. 

I started to ween off her, a few min every day at the end of work nothing as long as before, until I stopped altogether. And that's when I started having withdrawals. She was on my mind before but when I took the break I couldn't shake her. Every though was her and it was absolutely mind melting. I wanted to break free of it so, my solution was to go back to what we was doing. And then she took of me that soon she would be working on my shift. I was both exhilarated and terrified of the thought. I loved talking with this girl we had so much in common it felt like a natural match but in my foolish attempt at trying to find love I fell into a web.

But now it's gotten even worse. It's so bad that my thoughts have gone from her to dark thoughts because I now know that she has no feelings for me. It took a long time to figure this out but this girl is naturally flirty, and does this with everyone. But I'm still positive what we have is special compared to the rest. I dwell on this girl daily but it's not just her now. Thoughts of death and other things find there way into my mind as well  

All because I'm too big of a coward to admit my fellings or stand up for myself when the time arrives.

When she started we sat together every day at break time but now she opts to break by herself, what the hell? I never once eluded to get that I want anything romantic with her, I probably should have but I never did, and now I get this. I loved sitting with her, talking about nerdy stuff like anime and manga but now I feel so isolated. Not just from her but everyone and everything. Life doesn't feel the same anymore. 

I've always been a coward, I never talked to girls due to fear if rejection and I'm just terrible at coming up with conversation and I want more than anything to get away from anything that has to do with her. Should I quit my job? Surely that would help but I've been here almost 5 years, I don't know anymore.

 like a magnet, I'm drawn to her."

977,depression,Death or Recluse?,"I‚Äôve broken &amp; strained some good friendships in a certain environment in the past year, I left that space for a month or so, but recently went back to maybe meet new ppl but I found out that because of what I‚Äôve broke or drained there, I was super scared and paranoid that if I reached out to the new ppl that I was ok w, that I might break/strained those relationships again.

So my recent schools of thoughts are either not-totally reclusing myself: get a new phone and remain in contact w some close ppl, aside from my family. Or just commit suicide, cos I definitely can‚Äôt see a different path in the future.

My way of doing things and how I am is different, and how those friendships were broken/strained was because of my differences. And I can‚Äôt keep being me and keep forming &amp; breaking new friendships‚Ä¶.

980,depression,Day 1: The outbreak of war,"Yesterday I hit one of life's lows, today the counterattack commences. 

I slept very little last night but today I must try and fight back. 

I've started with the hardest part, I got out of bed. I showered, shaved and dressed, and that brings us to now. Not much of achievement, but a start. 

Plans for today. 

1. Have a small, healthy breakfast. 

2. Walk to the local clothing store, I need some running trainers, budget ones will do for a start. 

3. Potentially get a haircut, we'll see how busy it is and it's not a pressing need, but a step worth taking if I don't have to wait around for long.

4. Go to the supermarket. I'll need some healthy food and snacks, I will resist temptation and choose wisely. Some juice for the morning, fruit, granary bread, wraps and tune will be a start.

5. My son's stays at his grandparents tonight which, coincidentally, is also my temporary home. They have my old Lego, so I'm going to try and get the right side of the brain working and build him something before he comes home from school. 

Hold me to account for my actions."
981,depression,Over the last two years I have become really unmotivated in my education and life and I think it is due to depression,"To give a bit of background, I was really studious and I used to find studying fun. I used to enjoy the thrill of topping a test or getting compliments for my intelligence ever since I was a kid. 
That was until year 11 and 12 when I started to not do as good in tests and people I used to beat where now beating me in the same tests. Not to sound so egotistical but beating people in tests was one of my motivations and when all of sudden, when I stopped doing so I started to have feelings of self doubt that I was dumb and the only reason I did good academically was because everyone wasn't trying. The fact that year 11 and 12 (in Australia) are also vital to getting into a good university gave me more anxiety and dread that I never had before. Despite trying my best, I could never get the same ""high"" that I used to and I lost motivation to study and no matter how hard I tried, it was dissapointing result after dissapointing result. I asked my parents (who are Indian) but this led to more self doubt as they would give the same advice of "" You arent trying hard enough"" or ""You are playing too many video games"" despite it being at the peak of lockdown (mid 2020) and playing video games was a way for me to cope with the stress of school. 
Year 12 wasnt any better as I had done poorly on a test called the UCAT which was vital for me to get into my dream job of medicine and my school results werent any better than the previous year and my motivation for studying dropped even more and I started coming up with excuses that the teachers don't like as a coping mechanism but deep down, I had even more doubts about my abilities and my intelligence. 
Despite year 12 ending, I still have this feeling of self doubt and it has been made worse by not getting into any medical school, something that I thought was an attainable goal. While I do still have a course at uni which allows me to still pursue my dreams of becoming a doctor, I have immense dread when I think of starting my course and have feeling of never getting my goals no matter how hard I try.
Any ideas on how to get over this feeling of dread, anxiety and lack of motivation would help as I would like to regain the same motivation I had for life  and education that I had once before.

P.S sorry for such a long rant but I feel like a burden has been left of my chest. Sorry for any bad grammar as I typed this on my phone."
982,depression,I feel okay but empty (non native english),"Idk how to describe it maybe you know from just the title.

I really feel okay, still depressed from time to time, but not that lethargic or energy-less(?) anymore. I can get up in the morning for work, shower, keep my room kinda clean (cleaning at least once a week). I finally found friends that take me like I am. But still somethings missing and idk what.

Since my depression comes from repressed feelings and past unrequited love (i think but i aint sure) maybe the lack of a romantic binding causes me to feel like this. I mean my depression not only comes from these two things, it still makes a small amount of sense to me.

I have hobbies, daily social contacts, work and therefore income. But i still feel like thats not enough. Like if you drew a picture and can't finish it bc you don't know what to add but it feels unfinished.

And idk i really want to make something out of my life but i can't figure out what to do/become. My lack of interest in many things just hold me back from achieving goals. Like my job is good, but i don't like it and still any interest that I have won't ever create enough income to live if i would do it as a job.

Can somebody maybe help me figuring out what is missing in my Life?"
983,depression,More than words,"Do you feel its often just words and words in the grand scheme of things mean nothing. 

**People care about you;** *Then show me, don't tell me*

**You are loved**; *Then show me, don't tell me*

**You are not along;** *Then show me, don't tell me*

People who don't get depression love to use words that they think will make you feel better and suddenly be cured. ""You are loved"", ""People care about you"" great, thanks but those words are not going to stop the thoughts in my head, they aren't going to lift the fog and make everything brighter. Words are meaningless without action to back them up.

Don't tell me what you think I want to hear, in fact the only words that help are ""*how are you*"" but asked with a genuine sincerity and then listen, just listen. Don't judge, don't comment, don't try to come up with words to make me feel better, or suggestions on how I can sort my life out. Just listen and give me a hug. That's it.

I want someone to show me that they have taken time out from their day, their problems to sit with me and devote their time to me to just simply listen. Even if I have nothing to say."
984,depression,i feel like i always need more help than is available,"i should probably go to a psych ward, but i don't have health insurance, plus the pandemic. i should probably reach out to people who I'm positive love and care about me, but they're all busy juggling an increasing number of balls, and there's only so many hours in a day. i need someone to walk me through getting a job, but i'm 24 and expected to know how to be a normal person, there's nowhere i can go where someone will give me that kind of attention. i only see a therapist once every two weeks on average, enough time for me to fit in two nervous breakdowns.

everyone's hands are tied, and i'm slipping through the cracks. how can i not feel like a lost cause? i know 24 is still young, but not that young. and i dont know if i've got a lot of future left either way. there's just nothing in my life i can rely on to be there to help, anything could be taken away due to covid or time constraints or unaffordability or just bad luck. i haven't wanted to hurt myself this badly in a while."
985,depression,I cannot expect people to love me,"I cannot expect people to care for me. I cannot expect people to love me. But I can still attempt to help myself to love myself and with that, love other people as well even if it is one-sided.

Maybe that is why I am still trying to improve myself today and hopefully the days after too. Living is so so so painful. I really cannot bear the thought of someone else suffering, whether it is from depression or something else. But my ability is extremely limited; I will be satisfied if my potentially healthier future self can lighten the burden of someone, even if it is just one person.

I am an awful person. Maybe this is me trying to make myself appear noble. I am a horrible person.

Life sucks, and it will probably still be even if I appear to be moving forward. I do not have any expectations any more. What will be, will be.

Even if it is all for nothing, at least I can say to my miserable self that I tried.

I really feel awful right now and it will likely stay that way for a long time; but for those reading and not reading this, I wish you all the best."

I recovered and went to GYM and made new friends felt like they are close to me, but it‚Äôs just fake. They only like me when I am supporting them, but they really never asked about how I am doing. When I looked at them treating me it was just their benifits.

I fell inlove with a really lovely girl 2 years ago. She made me feel like I am a special person. She was the only one to know and feel when I am sad I really loved her I was excited everytime we meet, but she was just having fun she was faking or actually having benifits from me having a car, also used me to be protected from others. Plus she cheated on me with some other handsome guy.

I don‚Äôt know how to express my feelings anymore I have got no one to talk to. My memory is becoming too short. When I talk to people I might repeat the same word 2 or 3 times like my brain is lagging. My body went from 80kg with a good muscle shape to 60kg. I dont have feelings for anyone anymore I have tried to love but I just dont feel anything anymore I just wanna shutdown. I have been a smoker for 2 years now it helped me at the start to forget about thinking but now it doesnt.

992,depression,Can‚Äôt stop ruminating about my past,"My depression got diagnosed when I started university (2016).I struggled so much to get treatment. It didn‚Äôt get better. I got kicked out of my dream school in 2020.  It killed all my dreams. I always wanted to stay in academics. I was so involved on campus too. Now I have nothing. 

Today I came upon my transcript of my grades in first year and never realized how great I actually did despite all my mental health problems and this made me spiral. I can‚Äôt stop thinking what I could‚Äôve been if I wasn‚Äôt stuck with this illness. I could‚Äôve been in med school right now. I could‚Äôve been in grad school. It‚Äôs so hard because my parents are immigrants too and I‚Äôm the first born. 

How do I get over this? I‚Äôm sobbing right now and this rumination of what could‚Äôve been keeps coming up especially with my birthday coming up."
993,depression,"Dropped out of college, heavily into alchohol, weed and abusing my prescription meds.","So this has been going on since my final year at high school. I was exceptionally well in my earlier years at school so my parents decided to send me to live in another place on my own where there were good educational institutions that would get me into a top level college. But the exact opposite happened. It started with missing out classes, binging tv shows 24x7 and eventually I got myself indulged with bad company, liquor &amp; weed. Noone ever forced me to do anything it was always my initiative and i slowly had mastered this habits or i atleast thought i had. From a studious popular kid I went to a spoiled bully-ish brat and I was having a great time too. Everyone respected me when i smoked the most amounts of weed or took down 10 shots in one go. But it all went down when our college entrance exam‚Äôs results got out and my parents really got to know what was going on. I was grounded for 2 months in our home. Forced to prepare for more entrance exams and was terribly depressed at the moment which was totally ignored by my parents but eventually things got back to normal and somehow i maneged to convince my parents to send me back to the same place where i was preparing for my entrances for one more year. By the end of that year I had become a full blown drug addict and got involved with even worse company and illicit activities but still somehow i managed to score decent marks to get like a tier 3 college but my parents insisted i choose a college in my hometown which i thought was not a big deal since i would be in college but i did not realise that their supervision of me would affect me so hardly as i had been freely for almost 3 years. Throughout the first year the weed and alcohol had continued and i started missing classes here in college too. Didn‚Äôt even give the final exams too and then came the Covid. A perfect chance to redeem myself by staying at home and focussing on myself but instead what do i do? Lie about my online classes, smoke weed NOW IN MY HOME and do nothing. And by the second year of covid i had enough and my tolerance of stress levels reached a breaking point and i tried finish myself but got somehow saved and now I‚Äôm on meds and therapy but none of it seems to work so occasionally i binge drink or smoke again. But the main issue is now that my family has told me to take my own time I‚Äôm feeling more and more worthless without any motivation to do anything productive and it‚Äôs just me playing fifa all day and get annoyed at my family."
994,depression,Don't know what to do without substances,"I've been really depressed for about three years now, since my 2nd year of college. I wake up and go to bed with this immense despair in my chest and dissociate for long periods of time. When I ""wake up"" from these bouts, I only look at myself with more guit and disappointment.  I've tried therapy for a bit through my school's counseling services but my contact in the program quit and I sort of fell off too. These days I just sit and distract myself for 90% of my waking hours. I go to a pretty good school but I've begun to fail classes in the past year and no one other than me knows. I've tried to go easier on myself and tell myself that it's ok to mess up. But I just keep losing parts of myself that I value because of it. 

I smoke a lot of weed, I'm pretty much high throughout the day, and I drink before bed every night. It's really the only thing that alleviates it for a bit. I've been home for the holidays and due to omicron I have to be here for abt 3 more weeks. I really don't know what to do if I can't get my hands on something. I've been smoking since my freshman year and it's about a pack a day so that's tough to go without too. 

Is there anything easy and soft I can do to lessen the pain without regular access to drugs? I really have no clue how to move forward from here and I'm panicking."

1008,depression,"It feels like I'm struggling to be happy, even though on the outside, my life looks great.","I don't even know how to untangle it all. I just feel let down by everyone who's supposed to care and help me. Since I had my daughter last year, nobody in my husband's family really checks in on me. It's especially hard because I don't talk to my own family. I just don't feel supported. I've never felt so lonely in my life. 

I texted different people in my husband's family about how I was struggling with the baby by myself (husband was out of state for work for 4 months) and nobody responded to me. My MIL never texted me back, never called me, nothing. My SIL said she was too busy lately to talk. They all knew I was struggling with mental health and physical health problems but nobody asked me about my heart or my wrist or how I was coping with a new baby by myself. Husband came home from out of state and all we do is fight. 

I just wish I could fall asleep and not wake up sometimes. Or I wish I could wake up as someone else. But I can't because I have a daughter now. Wanting not to be here anymore isn't an option anymore because of my daughter and I couldn't ever leave her anyway. But I'm so lonely. And I don't know how to cope. And it makes me miss my mother because she had it worse than me but I can't talk to her anymore.

And my sister is in basic training and I miss her so much my heart is broken. And my favorite dog is dead. I just want my husband and I to stop bickering. I want my medication to work already.

I don‚Äôt know how to tell my friends I‚Äôm suffering so much and I have no other option but to continue pulling through or just give up. My cousin already committed suicide and I saw how much my family suffered including me. I hate everything about where I am and anything that awaits me.

1011,depression,Thoughts for supporting a romantic partner,"My (34m) partner/wife (35f) started experiencing symptoms of depression soon after our one and only kid (5f) was born. It hasn't gotten better now after a few years of meds and therapy, at least from my perspective.

She recently told me that she doesn't really look forward to anything in life. When she thinks about a family trip we have coming up, the feelings that come up are stress and anxiety. She denies any suicidal intention, is open with me that she sometimes longs for death, just to not have to deal with any of it anymore. 

She still laughs, keeps in close touch with two of her close friends, and is a BAMF at her full time, demanding job. She functions. Totally has it together, 100%, from the outside looking in.

But I feel like she has this sense of despair and hopelessness that can express sometimes at home, in interactions with both myself and our kiddo. She is still a great mom but it is hard for me to say that she is a great partner at the moment. Life is demanding and my needs are not something she has a great deal of ""space"" or ""emotional bandwidth"" for very often. At least, that is how I feel. It is all she can do to get through the day until the kid is put to bed, often. 

I am struggling lately with what I can do, both for her and myself. I know that I cannot by force of will pull another person out of a depressive state. But when she basically tells me that she doesn't experience joy anymore, I am at a loss as to what to do or say, other than to listen and be there. I want to be a support for her. A counterweight to the factors contributing to her depression. But I do not know what that looks like.

And in the meantime I have been struggling myself with a loss of intimacy, of carefree playful love, and of the sense of security of my partner's perceived happiness. And that is to say nothing of several other marital struggles we have experienced in the past few years. 

If anybody has thoughts on how to nurture a vivacious romantic relationship with a person struggling with depression, I would very much appreciate it."

Everyone says I am smart, but I'm not. I'm an idiot at everything I do. I make kindergarten level errors. There's nothing redeemable or unique about me.

I've tried and tried....but I always fail. Sometimes I have happy periods where I can pretend I'm not an absolute failure, but those pass with time.

I want to just end my life now. I'll never be good at anything. I'll never meaningfully improve. I'm too stupid to get anywhere. So why not just die and cut to the chase?"

Living in hatred is not survivable.,"I‚Äôve spent the last five years of my life running away from my problems. I had some very traumatic friendships and relationship end and it hurt me too much, I dropped off the face of the earth, changed my name, and spiraled into a mess of depression, self destruction and eventual suicide attempts. I just couldn‚Äôt live with what happened and what I lost.

Five years later, as of a few weeks ago, I came out of hiding finally and reached back out to those people I had just vanished on for years. It meant so much hearing how much I mattered and they missed me. And the worst one- the relationship that went south, I reconciled with them too. Having a chance to talk and apologize for our mistakes. It gave me closure for wounds I‚Äôve let bleed for half a decade in silence.

This was the biggest mistake I‚Äôve made, so please, consider restoring connections with those you‚Äôve missed, do what you can to mend and forgive. Living in hate and spite is not survivable. I wish I could go back and change things. I‚Äôve ruined my life over running from my past. Don‚Äôt do what I did."

I still have friends but I've slowly stopped talking to them recently because I feel like I suck the life out of every conversation and I've become more and more distant..

After my friend was in rehab for over a month due to spice and seeing him suffering from severe depression made me feel less alone. I don't know why but seeing him struggle helped me a lot. But the thing is, a few months later, even after his girlfriend breaks up with him and him failing an entire semester he seems so much happier now. HOW??? I'm still struggling every day and he just fixed his life and seems so enthusiastic and happy and full of energy now and I don't see a world in which something like that can happen to me.

Nothing traumatic or bad has ever happened to me which I am thankful for but at the same time I wish I had something that I could fix in my life so I could pretend like I'm getting better and improving. How long do I have to keep ""focusing on myself""? I've done everything I can. Even when I was in a relationship I still wanted to die everyday.

After mustering up a lot of courage I tried talking to my parents about it but they just brushed it off. The only way I believe I could improve my life is by getting treatment or medication I don't think therapy will help me personally. My life is a nightmare."

1028,depression,Is this depression or loneliness? Or both?,"I work at a hospital as a housekeeper. It's been a good place to work at to help me get through during COVID. I've been there since September of 2020. However on November 2021, three coworkers (one of them being my supervisor) transferred to another hospital. I was offered it but turned it down for various reasons. I've seen people come and go during my time there but ever since those three left, things haven't been the same. We lost a handful of employees the weeks following (for whatever reason) and we're down to the like 5-10 (including me) now and that's quite low for the second shift. I think we're losing more people than gaining. The work environment just feels empty now. I'm not very close to any of the employees including the three who left (and I'm not blaming them for what happened) but I did appreciate having company around me and I made small talk with them. Hearing them chit chat and laugh during break/lunch, walking out with them after work, all that. It made me feel less lonely but now that most of them are gone, I feel more alone and somewhat saddened. I'm assigned at the E.R most of the time and I get along with the staff there. Again not close with them but still liked having them around. I just didn't talk with them much like I did with the housekeeping staff. I've graduated before the pandemic started and I'm not in debt but this job was  just to help me get by. I think it's time I moved on and started looking elsewhere."
1029,depression,"Being near death felt peaceful, I can't get over the feeling.","So 10 months ago I gave birth and afterwards I hemorrhaged because of blood clots in my uterus. After not being able to sleep properly for the last couple of months (for perspective I slept more and better with a newborn in a cot next to me) and having a rough birth (episiotomy and forceps delivery as my labour stalled when I was fully dilated to to an Autism mental breakdown and being unable to cope) it felt lovely to just lie on the bed and relax. 

I was drifting in and out if sleep while the midwife was doing whatever, just happy I had my baby and that it was all over and I could rest. Then my blood clots were discovered and there was about 10 members of staff all flooding into the room, I was low on oxygen so they put the mask on me and they were talking to me trying to keep my conscious. I knew it was serious by the look on my husband's face but I didn't care, I didn't even try to fight to stay awake, I just wanted to sleep. The moments I was unconscious were so peaceful and painfree it was lovely and freeing. I think this is one of the best feelings I have had in my entire life, it's really hard to rank them when this feeling just feels so engrained in my head.

I think all the crazy hormones had been overriding all of this as it didn't bother me for months but recently my mental health has taken a big downturn and all the pregnancy hormones are a great deal lower as I am not doing much breastfeeding anymore. I am struggling to sleep at night and in the daytime I just feel tired and irritable. In the past I have contemplated how I would like to just be dead and no longer have to deal with depression and now I have this feeling of a peaceful passing it's just haunting me, also taunting me. 

I always wanted to have at least 2 children but pregnancy and childbirth were so awful I don't know if I can go through it again. The pregnancy hormones were so crazy and mind altering even when I was in labour I was screaming next time I wanted a cesarean but now I can barely stomach the idea of doing it all again. I am concerned that if my mental health gets worse I may decide to get pregnant again for the wrong reason (wanting to try for that peaceful passing I nearly had before) and instead be stuck going through a distressing labour and being denied a cesarean as I had fully dilated so quickly. 

I just can't sleep and my thoughts of all of this are keeping me up at night and I needed to write it all down for some reason."

1034,depression,How much of this depression is Mine and what am I carrying of yours?,"TL;DR: dealing with a split after a 4yr situationship has me questioning if I‚Äôve always had these depressive tendencies, or am I a byproduct of a narcissist 

Hi, I (38f) have recently ended a 4yr situationship (not amicable, nor my decision).  The person relocated to an entire different continent.  This is has conjured a slew of never before experienced aftermath.  I‚Äôm 38 so this is far from my first ending, relocating either on my behalf or theirs has always been a factor.  Followed by the traditional NC.  This ending followed the same formula.  But THIS time, THIS has summoned a slew of all new aftermath.  I have accepted that I have always had mental health issues, yet was ‚Äúfortunate‚Äù enough to navigate around them. I have also accepted that this emotional state is not the smartest time to get a clear perspective on my specific defectors.  

This situationship was largely based and rooted in mental health and self harm and suicide attempts (that I was never supposed to be home for, but would pop up for some random ass reason and fuck up plan).  Depression had a major authority of our days potential for what could or couldn‚Äôt get accomplished.  I NEVER seen this as a deal breaker (and not bc I wanted to save them) but bc They WANTED to help themselves, and it‚Äôs not in me to quit on ANYONE that‚Äôs wants to improve, but may need some unconditional cheering along the way.  And of course , I loved this person, but I‚Äôve done the same thing for people I have Never had any amorous fancy for. 

 There were times this depression was a major ass inconvenience and frustrating AS FUCK!  but NEVER, did I blame or shame the person for their depression.  Never did I taunt, tease, bully, manipulate, or bring up as any form of a negative factor.  NEVER did I allow anyone else or themselves for that matter do any of those things either. And with their effort/desire for a different life, Much trial and error, and much trust / understanding; we as a team Developed some tools to help navigate through depression.  Once progress gained traction, Real Lasting Results were achieved.  

Part of me is wondering though, if part of my understanding for the situation came From Understanding.  I never really shared much of my relatability to their situation.  I didn‚Äôt want to be that person that is the ‚Äòme too‚Äô friend or do anything to have the focus be shared.  By all rights, I was ‚Äúmanaging‚Äù mine and my shit paled in comparison to the volatile shifts depression would thrash them through.  And although they shared expressions of gratitude, I think it was only surface level.  But I appreciated the appreciation so I wasn‚Äôt going to shit on their expressions.  

Enter present time, they went back and forth between NC and full on engaging in conversation.  Then one day within a matter of an hour and a half, they went complete NC.  Which I respect, (honestly) as part of their reason for leaving was to HEAL.  And I can understand keeping communication with me I‚Äôm sure muddles this process.  Then after 2 weeks or so, I came across a post where they were completely shitting on me (with fabrications on top of that) ON A POST THEY MADE about missing me.

I privately confronted them.  And have let it be.  But my current brain space has had to acknowledge some things.  1) I said I understand his choice to go NC, so the following statement SHOULDN‚ÄôT matter.  (but there are a lot of things not mentioned that lead to there needing to be a follow up to my previous statement).  2) I WOULD BE HURT AND SAD BY THE NC, but I would RESPECTFULLY understand and deal with it, knowing it was part of the process.  as NC is to preserve one‚Äôs mental fortitude and is necessary at times.. however ..the silent treatment, is VERY different (in my understanding) as it‚Äôs a weaponized withholding of love/affection for punishment.  ummmmmm, I‚Äôm currently confused on why I‚Äôm not just able to take this L instead of being furious at the situation.  I‚Äôm confused on if I‚Äôm angry bc this is intentional hurt, bc the ‚Äúmanaged‚Äù grip I had on my mental health issues wants to give way but I‚Äôm not confident in my own self cheerleading skills, or if I‚Äôm becoming depressed and self doubting as the result of dealing with a narcissist.."
1035,depression,Envy and exclusion,"Lately, I‚Äôve felt displeasure a lot in the last week. I came home for the holidays only to realize it‚Äôs not what I thought it was going to be. The situation is too specific to get into but the emotions are quite simple. The last 3 days, I‚Äôve been very irritated and depressed. Out of the family, I feel that I‚Äôve been given the short-end of the stick. I haven‚Äôt cut myself in 3 years and tonight I had the thought. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. I feel the need to get high and relapse. My freedom has been restricted and it has made me feel so upset, I have grown numb. I just want to feel pleasure and no more pain. Self-destruction isn‚Äôt the answer though. I‚Äôm ready to go back home where I can roam freely."
1036,depression,I'm lost and I don't know what to do,"Everyday I walk through life like a zombie, I've never experienced love, the few friends I have just want me around because I'm helpful or serve a purpose to them. Anytime anyone calls or texts me its if they need anything. I was bullied my entire life because I deserve to be. I've never been in a relationship and it's not from lack of trying. It seems like no one wants me. I'm so alone in a sea of people. Every day I wish I wasn't born, I've struggled and continue to struggle. I can't talk to anyone and no one is there for me. I just want to be happy. I don't know if I have ever been."

1040,depression,I want to look at myself in a mirror and not feel embarrassed of myself,"I just want to look at my reflection and feel proud,instead i only see a walking piece of shit that doesn't deserve anything, why does my mom,dad and sister even love me, im useless,i barely go out,have almost no friends, too scared to even talk to people, and when i gather the courage to go somewhere i feel physically like shit,i just want to vomit all the time, im just wasting space and air, I don't deserve anything,my family got the wrong son, the only reason im still breathing is because of my mom,dad and sister.
I don't want to hate myself anymore."

1042,depression,I‚Äôm getting better,"After seven years of being treated for a mayor depression, I‚Äôm finally starting to be lower dosed. 
I hope I get to start living life without any medication, since I‚Äôve never experienced a lot of things (like ando orgasm) without being under the influence of antidepressants or/and sleeping pills. 
This is a small victory for me. I couple years ago I thought I was going to end it. But know I feel ok with my physical existence and experience. 
I don‚Äôt fear death nor I try to cause it by myself anymore and that makes me live life in some sort of comforting calm.

1047,depression,"22M, out of college, very much want this to end","Broke up with my college girlfriend back in August and I have been blocked off for about 3 months now. From hindsight I was gaslighted during my relationship when my ex would blame me for the reason why she had to abort our accidental child. I ‚Äúmanipulated‚Äù her into getting the procedure. In especially the month of October I pretty much felt dead inside and I would literally visualize like her, a makeshift child, and myself. It was fucking horrible. Afterwards I was dealing with obsessive thoughts about my jealousy on what she was doing and if she was moving on and whatever. It fucking sucks because I work a sales job so at the same time I‚Äôm forced to act joyous and happy in the day time when internally I genuinely want to end it all. Hearing my housemates have sex literally reminds me if my ex is having sex with someone else. If I walk past by a couple or if I see a food place we went to, I immediately think about my ex like instantly. The topic of sex, intimacy, or coupling just makes me so jealous and sad. If I find casual sex with a girl, I immediately feel empty right after and think about what my ex is doing. I‚Äôve been working out so much and I‚Äôve been looking a lot better and I go out in the day and I smile like everything is okay. My friends knew I was depressed before but now they think it‚Äôs all alright. In reality I genuinely want to die. Sorry this was a long rant. I hate the lifestyle my housemates live of just hooking up and partying. I‚Äôm over that now I wanna do real stuff. Point is I‚Äôm very very lonely I just want a hug man, I wanna stop having an unhealthy relationship with sex and jealousy feelings, work is getting stressful because I need to hit my Quota, I‚Äôm just so annoyed and tired all the time. The only time I‚Äôm happy is in the gym. God I hope this will pass, feeling like this since august and it‚Äôs gotten worse every month.

You keep people away because you don't want to get hurt, then you get sad cause you have no one, so you let someone in. They tell you, reassure you that they're there for you. They force you to be open. You fight it. You tell them you appreciate them, but you don't want to talk about things. They push you to share. You finally do. Where are they? No response. Or ""sucks, bro"".

I get it. Just be patient. But you can reply within a second of them texting you, so you know they're on the phone, and still nothing. You hang out and see them on their phone the whole time. Any time it buzzes, quick response. It used to be like that with you. There was a time when if I didn't respond, they'd ask if I was annoyed with them. So it is just me.

At a point, I think I gave up on myself, gave up on waiting for help. Accepted the abuse and stopped trying. I thought that I'd get up and leave and be happy but now it just seems like a waste of time.

I'm not cut out for that life. Not pretty, smart or driven enough. I hate that but I know I can't change it. I just feel like I'm worth nothing and like this is as far as my story goes and that I'll be left as some nobody, and for the first time I'm okay with that.

I don't know why I'm posting this, I don't care about it much but for some reason, I keep hoping that I'm wrong and help will come. I just want all of this to end. I'm scared it never will.

1066,depression,When will it get better,"Everyday is a struggle. There isn‚Äôt a single day in my life where I haven‚Äôt been stressed or worried or enjoy life.

I‚Äôve been diagnosed with ADHD, BPD, OCD, CPTSD, Social Anxiety, and depression.

It started off with me being diagnosed with ADHD and I luckily found success with medication. 

But then once I started college I just became a mess. Which is when recently I was diagnosed with everything mentioned aside from ADHD.

Everyday I struggle to keep my BPD thoughts from impacting me. I‚Äôm always getting mad at my friends who only care about me. They don‚Äôt have anything against me, it is just all in my head. 

I don‚Äôt understand what I did to deserve this life. 

My parents are also narcissistic so that‚Äôs adds on top of the problems I‚Äôm dealing with.

I don‚Äôt have the energy to vent anymore. I‚Äôm just tired of life. I don‚Äôt see it getting any better. I can‚Äôt even get therapy because my parents control everything in my life. 

I tried recently to explain to my parents how I went behind their backs and got diagnosed. But they didn‚Äôt even care and got mad at me. 

After this I‚Äôve just been feeling very hopeless towards life. Nothing is enjoyable. I can only get irritated. Im only hurting those who care about me. I‚Äôm only here because I‚Äôm scared to end it all."

1068,depression,Stuck in my head,"Everyday all day I constantly am so mean to myself and every little thing I say I feel so stupid and obnoxious after.

1069,depression,Life has become overwhelming,Probably the worst year on record. For one my drinking was getting out of hand. It started to scare me so I basically stopped cold turkey. I was feeling something was seriously off about my body. I started to arrange heart check ups. (Turns out things are probably ok). I‚Äôm overweight and smoke weed so I was super concerned. I was feeling and impending sense of doom. Odd thing was maybe it wasn‚Äôt about me. My mom called me randomly one night to tell me my cousin had died. He killed himself unfortunately. He was like a big brother to me. My family is really close because of my grandma in some ways. Thing was she was on her deathbed pretty much when my cousin died. We didn‚Äôt really realize at the time. She died a week later. We didn‚Äôt tell her about my cousin. But my family had to watch her die basically with the knowledge that her grandson was dead. 2 wakes. 2 funerals. 2 celebrations of life. I wanna drink to numb that pain. I barely can. You can say I‚Äôve relapsed maybe but not really. I smoke so much weed as well. Maybe what I‚Äôm feeling in my chest is my lungs actually. Which sucks too since I should probably look into that. I‚Äôm also a musician. Struggling no doubt. I recently got a manger and things are usually fine but sometimes he hurts my feelings. I let him know that today and he took it badly. I thought it would be good for me to say some of these things. I said I feel like sometimes he doesn‚Äôt have my back and I think that was a big deal. I think he might quit which would f‚Äôing suck. His dad passed away earlier this year. I think we‚Äôre both emotionally f‚Äôed up. I don‚Äôt want him to quit. It‚Äôd be the cherry on top to the worst year of my life. Not to mention my awful love life. That‚Äôs a whole other story but basically this girl that I thought I‚Äôd finally get together with ghosted me and moved away and found a new boyfriend the first week she moved away. She texts me from time to time which also sucks because I just wanna tell her how she f‚Äôed me up. Family life is messed up. Love life sucks. Im afraid my manager will quit. Feels like my musics career is going nowhere. Beer/weed is an issue. I also just turned 30 which kinda sucks too. Feels like my life is coming crashing down. Feels like life is winding down too. I already had issues prior to all this and it feels like my issues have just been exasperated by all this. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.
1070,depression,I want out,"I was popular and fell out with ALL of them beginning of this year. Made some new friends, all of them justified the shit way my ex-best friend treated me. Constantly saying I should get over it and that I was all of the things she said I was.

Fell out with one, she constantly said I wasn't someone she wanted to be seen with. No one else batted an eye, decided to drop all of them the same. 

Everyone else thinks I'm weird and doesn't like me. The only friend I have never takes my side and is super close to everyone who treated me like shit.

I'm in my fourth friend group over the year after having to move for one reason or the other and I'm just fucking sick of it. Sick of everyone.

I hate this stupid town and all these stupid fucking people.

1092,depression,All I feel is numb now,"I‚Äôm a senior in high school, I moved to a whole new school in a totally new environment my junior year and ever since I have been completely alone. As an introvert I figured I would get use to it and I guess for a while I did but these past few months I have really been thinking that damn I will likely never have any close relationships ever again. I‚Äôve tried making friends and I try talk to people but none want nothing to do with me. I‚Äôm the kid that sits by himself at lunch and doesn‚Äôt say a word so nobody wants to be associated with me. The past week over break I really haven‚Äôt done anything besides work (which I do all alone) and sit in my dark room. I‚Äôve pretty much stopped eating, I wake up and the taste of food makes me feel sick, all throughout the day I don‚Äôt have appetite for anything and every time my parents try to talk to me I just get so annoyed and end up storming off to go be alone. I know they mean well but I just snap and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. When I lay in my bed I genuinely feel nothing just numbness. I don‚Äôt want to end it but at the same time I don‚Äôt want it to go on anymore. I just want somebody to pay attention to me and just give me a chance."
1093,depression,Tomorrow is Monday again....,"Thanksgiving break is already over. I don't want to go back to work. I am so tired of living. People are going to ask me what I did for thanksgiving, and I need to come up with a lie like with everything else. The truth is, I did nothing. I can't even get myself out of bed to do anything. But of course, I can't tell people that. So I have to lie. I have to pretend that I am normal and have a life. GODDAMN IT, I AM SO SICK OF IT! I hate this. I hate work. I hate society. I hate expectations. I hate people. I hate everything, including myself. Actually, I hate myself the most. It is obvious that I'm the problem here. Killing myself would be the right thing here. Then the problem would be removed. Yes, that it."

How the fuck can i be unhappy ? i hate myself for not being happy even tho i have it so good it kills me everyday to see how much worse some people have it . They can say that their lives are sad i shouldn't be allowed to be sad WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME !?"
1097,depression,I‚Äôm too overwhelmed and it doesn‚Äôt seem worth it.,"
I have a lot of past hurt from people I love like my sisters who are my life. I live for them and it‚Äôs sad they bully me to the point I can‚Äôt think of myself in a positive way. Parents have high expectations that have crushed me I never feel like I am enough for them. Don‚Äôt have many friends because I have traveled all my life first time I went over seas I was 5yr even at that age I basically left everyone I loved other then my family. I would meet a friend get close then we would travel again and I would never see them again and that‚Äôs the pattern of my life . I have been depressed for 4 years and have had persistent thoughts of suicide for 2 years. I‚Äôm not ‚Äúsmart‚Äù but I‚Äôm homeschooled and my mom is a terrible teacher and doesn‚Äôt know what to do with me because I‚Äôm VERY dyslexic so I can‚Äôt learn shit and you will probably notice I have really bad grammar. So I would give my 100% for my parents to call me lazy. There are so so many thing I‚Äôm supposed to do but I don‚Äôt want to do anything I just want to stop hurting. Recently it has been so bad I feel like the only way to distract my mind is a razor blade. The world is so overwhelming so many things I ‚Äúhave too do‚Äù and I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt face my parents again and have them tell me how I should feel and how shellfish I am when I stopped living for myself a long time ago. I‚Äôm 14M and I can‚Äôt go a minute without wishing I wasn‚Äôt born. I haves never actually attempted but I have gotten really close. I don‚Äôt want to die but this hurts to much."
1098,depression,Heavy marijuana use ruined my life,"I was a student, in high school not doing great, not doing terribly, but i was doing okay. Then I discovered smoking with some people who just wanted to use me because I had a house they could use where I was alone on the weekends. 

I stopped paying all that much attention academically. I started just focusing on smoking. I finished with middling grades and then took two gaps years where I just smoked and worked a bit. I then went to H√∏jskole where I also mostly focused on smoking and having fun, alone or with a few friends, in my room. No parties, no socializing, in the most important part of a young mans life, another regret. I met an amazing girl who was visiting from the US, but I could still only focus on smoking and not see how amazing she was. 

Then the pandemic began and she was sent home to her own country. I came to visit her, but I bungled it up big time, because I mostly just wanted to smoke and couldn't see the forest for the trees. I fucked it up so bad with both her, and her parents. You wont even believe how big time I fucked it up. 

I went back home, we broke up. I continued my education to become a teacher, but I mostly just did that so I could continue smoking and read a bit, but mostly smoke. 

Now that vie stopped smoking completely, after 5 years of heavy using, I completely hate my life. I lost my chance with the most amazing girl in the world. I lost my chance to get a good education even though I have a good head on my shoulders. All to this, god, damn, plant! 

I thought the plant would help save me from social situations, but it just stopped me from growing and kept me stagnant. It has ruined my whole god damn life and I cant see a way to pull back up from what has happened. I feel outside suicidal and I want to end it because I cant see a way that I can achieve a life that I would enjoy without smoking now. I want to be a doctor, or a lawyer, something that makes sense and is meaningful, but the god damn plant has ruined that for me. 

I want to be done with this existence, because this is too much. It makes me so sad how much I ruined everything for both her, and for me. This is all too much. I want to turn back time, but I cant. This is just too much."
1099,depression,Depression with psychotic features,"I hear things, see things, and oftentimes believe what I sense. When these phenomena occur to me, they‚Äôre not witnessed by others. I see different colored orbs of light, I can smell things others can‚Äôt, which can be funny, but it concerns me. I‚Äôve heard voices of course. Strangely these voices are all different. I‚Äôve had dreams that come true. I‚Äôve spent some time locked up, which kept other people from thinking about me, but it didn‚Äôt help me. What has helped me the most, is living subsistently and making extra money for cash. This very controlled and monitored society is diametrically opposite of what I‚Äôve learned I require. My symptoms have calmed some since I spend more time alone doing meaningful that requires learning."

1101,depression,Depressed and stuck in a loop,"Hello. I'm a 30 y/o female. I've been depressed as long as i could remember.  Well maybe starting in middle school. It got bad when I was 25 after I had my baby but now I'm in therapy and have been on meds for over 2 years now. I know medications aren't the cure all for depression, and they did take the edge off but lately,  idk if it's with the holidays coming or what, I've felt more depressed than ever. I've surpassed the sad and angry feelings of the past prior to medication but instead I'm just almost like defeated. I just dread every day and just want to sleep all day every day. I barely want to eat most days and normally force myself. The days just go on like im on autopilot. Like i blink and it's night time again. I'm still able to push myself to carry on with my daily responsibilities and routine, but it's a struggle. Idk I'm pretty broke too financially and with Christmas coming, that's making me feel even more depressed.  I haven't been able to afford it for the past few years. I'm just dreading it all. Dreading the monotony of everyday life. So yeah I just want to live in my dark room every day but can't. Anyone else feel this way? I'm just venting I guess. Looking for some solidarity or insight."
1102,depression,Dysthymia - High Functioning Depression Experiences,"I have functional depression. I use 100% of my daily energy to complete my demanding job. What is left I dedicate to parenting.

I have no energy left for anything else which means:

1. I only clean my house on the weekends because I don't work weekends and have more energy. This takes up both weekend days.
2. I rarely cook for myself and eat out or pre-made food all days.
3. When an unexpected crisis happens I have no energy to deal with it
4. Exercise makes me physically exhausted
5. I am always in reaction mode, I don't have enough energy to be preventative
6. I experience anhedonia on a daily basis
7. I am motivated to work only by the thread of being fired/eventual homelessness
8. I see my friends (those I have left) about once every 3-4 months because I need my weekends to complete livings tasks and weekdays I'm too tired.

It used to be better. I used to have energy to exercise, but it's gradually gotten worse over the years rather than better.

Anyone else want to share their experiences?"
1103,depression,Just got out of hospital TW:Suicide,I had an open bottle of propane in my car. Someone smelled it and opened my door when I was passed out. I just want to sleep.

My heads throbbing from the propane but I can‚Äôt sleep. I guess I just want someone to talk to.
1104,depression,Thoughts on Sucide,I have thought about killing myself since I was in middle school. But I never planned in detail how I would go about it.

Each year I get worse until now where I don't leave my room to eat or use the bathroom. I just lay that is really all I want to do for months and it's getting worse. I want to be dead by 30 but I feel it's wishful thinking because I am a coward. I hate that I am still letting myself live when I know I will die old and alone. I just feel I am not going to have a good future if I keep living. That despite how I feel right now this is as good as it gets and it'll only get worse from here. I hate myself for this I can't see a good future for myself at all. I just don't want to be here anymore I feel miserable. I just don't want to be old and alone and regret not killing myself sooner. I have my parents but they don't understand and they will die one day and my brother will get his life and I will be alone and rot. I have no future in this world

1106,depression,I'm just gonna say it,"The reason I'm suicidal is because I feel as though I failed at life. Everytime I ever felt that way it was because I felt I had failed. And while many times I felt that way and was able to bounce back. There's always something else, something new to believe. This time things are different. As I've failed the most important thing of all. Being a father and family man. I couldn't make it work with the mother of my children. Things have spiraled so badly she's even pregnant with our thrid child and we have zero communication. This unstoppable feeling of failure. This no re-thinking this. This was my life and that was supposed to be my family but I failed. My choices and decisions in-between has led to this crumbling family structure. A family structure I cannot accept. It was my life to craft and this is wrong."
1107,depression,What am I doing,I've had extreme depression and high functioning anxiety for a little over 2 years now. After graduating college and not finding a job I am finding it hard to have a purpose. Some days I feel like running away from everyone and all my responsibilities. It's exhausting pretending to be okay all the time. I don't know how to be happy without medication and I feel guilty relying on pills to stay mentally stable.
1108,depression,Trauma induced major depression is turning my friend into an overly dependent person. Any suggestions?,"My friend (24 F) has been facing depression since a year and a half now due to the death of a loved one. Not only has she not been able to process the grief properly but because of a lot of unanswered questions about life, she always feels hopeless and afraid. All of this has resulted in her being an overly dependent person in some aspects of life (she has job which is a good thing). She has supportive parents and friends but no one can be there for her all the time. And sometimes this dependence isn't received well by her parents who belong to the generation where you must move on. 

I understand that therapy and medication is an option but due to her personal experiences, she is unwilling to start that. 
I am afraid that once her parents, who aren't exactly understanding of her mental state, get frustrated and ask her to live on her own to learn discipline and whatnot, she might become even more depressed. 

How can I help her as a friend? Is being strict a good option here? I have tried doing that and she gets either angry or sad. Sometimes she says that she isn't dependent and it's just because others are ther for her that she acts the way that she does."
1109,depression,Depression and the body and a small balloon of sadness,"When depression gets really bad, it gets particularly physical, embodied. I don‚Äôt just mean tired, heavy arms and legs. I mean this sensation, a foreign object that feels like a ballon has suddenly installed itself under your rib cage, the pit of your stomach, and it‚Äôs full of a kind of sand esa that it light, like air, but takes up space and leaves you short of breath sometimes and you just want it to go away‚Ä¶"
1110,depression,any advice for someone‚Äôs who‚Äôs treatment resistant ?,"I have had severe depression and mild-severe anxiety since I was about 16. Was falsely accused of rape and my life has just spiralled ever since. 

I‚Äôm 24 now and the only relief I‚Äôve had in that time is the odd day here and there where I can keep my head above the water for more than what feels like half a second. 

I‚Äôve been on multiple anti-depressants, I‚Äôve been off anti-depressants, I‚Äôve kept a good sleep schedule, I‚Äôve been to therapy for multiple stints, I‚Äôve exercised, I‚Äôm in my last year at uni and just got some good grades back, I have no trouble with and am generally good at public speaking, I have a lot of friends, I have a great best friend of 20 years, I have some good people in my family (dad used to beat me when I was younger but we‚Äôre mostly good now), I‚Äôve tried meditation, I‚Äôve tried ignoring it, I‚Äôve tried facing it, I‚Äôve tried all sorts of techniques recommended through CBT sessions, I‚Äôve tried illegal drugs that supposedly help, I‚Äôve removed caffeine from my diet, I‚Äôve moved to a new town, I‚Äôve moved back home, I‚Äôve had multiple girlfriends and have never had trouble with women, I‚Äôve talked about it with friends and family. I try my best to live every day to be a good person and genuinely do think I‚Äôm a good person. 

Despite all of this, nothing offers any release.

Last year I came close to suicide but I‚Äôve managed to stave off doing that since.

Before things take a final turn, is there anything else anyone can recommend I try? I want to get better, I‚Äôm dying to get better, I‚Äôll try anything, it‚Äôs just that nothing works."
1111,depression,I feel like I'm constantly chasing a high I will never get back,"It's overwhelming knowing that I'll never enjoy life as much as I did when I was a kid.

Cant enjoy anything without my brain telling me Im a piece of shit every 2 min.
Havent showered in two weeks.
Have been locking myself in my room for the most times these past 3 weeks.

Im still a bit scared, but Ive decided to do it before the end of this year. Hope it'll go smoothly. Dont want to end up in the hospital afterwards."
1114,depression,Should i just give in to my suicidal thoughts,[removed]
1115,depression,There is so little left,"I do have some hope left, but it's completely irrational. I am incompatible with the expectations placed upon me and demands needed to survive. I have lived longer than I could hope for but I'm just waiting for the next bout of happiness to come around. I spent the whole day making sure everyone around was happy while I tear myself apart inside and have no hope for the future outside of the extreme short term. My current situation is bad, and I have no energy or ideas on how to fix it because I have kept making it worse for a year. I may have to end it soon but at least I am looking forward to something tomorrow so I might be able to pull through."
1116,depression,i want to go home but i cant,"im a week away from finishing my first semester of college and i haven‚Äôt felt worse in my life.

while i was in college, my mom sold my childhood home and moved to hawaii. which should be exciting, it‚Äôs hawaii. but i realized that i‚Äôm in no way connected to my hometown anymore. my parents don‚Äôt live there, my brother moved out a while ago, ive basically committed to living in my college town for the next couple of years, there is no home for me to go back to.

I always said that i wanted to leave, and now that i have i don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. I feel so stupid for wasting the time i had left there. at the same time i feel so stupid for missing somewhere so unremarkable. there‚Äôs nothing left for me in my hometown but i still cry about it. i dont have the time or money to go back and visit, and even if i did i doubt i‚Äôd enjoy it. i just don‚Äôt think i like the fact that i am fully disconnected from an entire chapter of my life.

winter break is coming up, which at my school lasts a little over a month. everyday i get closer to it i feel worse. more anxious, every little thing is overwhelming me. i don‚Äôt know how to talk to anyone about this, because, realistically, spending a month in hawaii should be better than going home. and yet im still unhappy. 

for the record i do have depression, diagnosis and ssri‚Äôs included. i feel like this is like exasperating everything just a little bit more. i also don‚Äôt have anyone else to talk to"

1118,depression,Just how I was feeling tonight. This isn‚Äôt usually me but I wanted to get this off of my chest. So hello strangers. This is new to me.,"Finding your place in a world that never stops. At times you are at your lowest with random curveballs that seem to only pop in at the times you‚Äôre most at peace. For some reason you have made it through some very low lows and felt nothing was looking up, now you feel like you‚Äôre on the cusp of finding your place. It feels as if any day something is going to pop out at you and change your life forever, if only it had your name on it, a sign saying choose me and your wildest dreams will become a reality. Somehow you have gotten to a place where money isn‚Äôt tight, you have everything you truly need and more. Yet content is the furthest thing from your mind. You still have this gut feeling someday and someday soon you‚Äôre about to have a huge change for the even better. You‚Äôll never know it until you take the risk of trying, or even searching for what it is. You have no clue yet you know it‚Äôs right there waiting. The thought of going out of your comfort zone frightens you and enlightens you. You want to change everyone who knows you‚Äôs perspective of yourself, but you don‚Äôt want to lose them. You don‚Äôt want to be a sheep you want to be a Shepard. You‚Äôre stable but feel below your peers and it eats you from the inside out. Why can‚Äôt you be ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù or even viewed as someone who could potentially be that. People seem to have think you are at your peek but inside you feel there‚Äôs so much more to yourself. Why can it look so easy to others what you truly want to be. You have a vision of yourself and don‚Äôt know what actions to take to make you look and be seen as the person you want to be seen as. You‚Äôre not a bad person, you‚Äôre not seen as a bad person. But you‚Äôre also never taken seriously and it‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings. You‚Äôre a pushover at best and can‚Äôt take the actions to change into what you want to be. But why? What‚Äôs stopping you from changing into the man you want to be? Validation is more important to you than the bliss of emotional freedom, you can only control what makes you happy in life but you‚Äôre too busy trying to make sure everyone else‚Äôs lives are perfect. Why? What causes this for you? Is it truly childhood trauma? It‚Äôs hard for you to grasp that seeing the things you saw as a child, the feelings you had, and the way you were treated can really dictate who you are today. You know if you want to change who you are it is ultimately up to you. You just have to force your subconscious mind to agree with you, but how? How do you rewire your brain to make you into your vision? You‚Äôre handsome and intelligent but that‚Äôs not how you‚Äôre viewed. You‚Äôre seen as goofy, dumb, emotionless. At times you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre seen as human as everyone else. You‚Äôre just existing in a space where others can easily overlook you and you feel distant at times and just want to be alone because you feel you don‚Äôt fit in. Why can‚Äôt you make it?"
1119,depression,I cry uncontrollably at night and I don‚Äôt know why,"I‚Äôve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and am currently on Lexapro, and throughout the day I‚Äôm usually alright but as it gets later into the night I find myself getting suicidal and very sad, sometimes to the point where I‚Äôm silently sobbing as I lay in bed at night.

Not just softly crying but aggressively crying to the point where I have to try my hardest not to make any noise which would wake up my family because I just want to scream and let it all out.

I try and distract myself by going on Reddit or watching YouTube but it doesn‚Äôt get rid of the immense pain I feel late at night.

I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else feels this way? Could I be bipolar?"

1121,depression,Depression has fucked up my memory.,I fell like depression has completely ruined both my short and long term memory. I can't remember things I was thinking about litterly like 10 seconds earlier. I also can't seem to remember things long term either. Not even the years before I became depressed. It all just feels like some kind of fog. I feel like my life is being ruined by me not being able to remember things.
1122,depression,I just can't get better,I don't even have much energy to type. All I know is that I hate everything this world has to offer and don't want to be here. I've been up and down and up and down. When can I just be normal? When can I get out of bed without going back to bed 2 hours later? When will I be able to stop myself from missing out in life? I hate myself.
1123,depression,There's no point,This is like the hundredth post I've made. So pathetic... I give up.
1124,depression,One thing I've noticed from being badly depressed...,Is that the same type of people who would make a post on every social media platform professing their lack of knowledge of your mental state are the same ones who will blow you off when you think you can reach out to them for help.
1125,depression,Rant. I need to get some things off my mind.,I am just so sick of people. I'm fucking sick of myself. I hate myself. I'm do nothing for no one and I'm just a leech. No job no money and a bunch of shit I need and have to pay for. Then when you're to the point where you've been suicidal for months and it's like wtf. I even made my therapist cry. I just give up. People say talk but it doesn't help or do anything. Anything you say they will minimize. Suicidal for this reason and not that? Not good enough. No one likes me. I pushed them all away. I dont talk to anyone. They don't even care anymore.
1126,depression,I hate my body,"I wish I could just stop existing, people at school have said that i look like a rapist as if that was just some funny joke.

I'm obese and I have ADHD, in other words I really want to do work and workout but I just lay in my bed until I fall asleep. It's hard to just do things, I hate my body. I hate my voice, I wish I couldn't talk. I know it sounds stupid, all of this does. But my voice is obnoxiously deep, and I'm still trying to figure it out but I know I'm not cis. I wish I could just stop my ability to talk. I've thought about just stabbing myself in the throat, but I don't know how well that would work. However if it did work It would either make me mute or kill me and I can't really complain either way.

I'm 14, feel free to say I'm too young for any of this, I'm fine with more reasons to kill myself. Feel free to call me a dumbass too trust me I know."

1128,depression,I just want to die,"I feel guilty every day because I feel like I've failed my family. I'm a university student and my parents are helping me out even though we're poor, and I'm not doing so good academically. I have a lot on my shoulders and I just want to rest. I thought things would get better once I got into college, but it's the same shit, except this time I have to pay. So now I'm just spending more money taking classes that I'm failing. I have to act as if I'm okay at home, but I'm not. I can't push myself academically anymore. I know I'm just whining and complaining when everyone has worse situations than me but I can't help feeling this way. Some days I'm happier than others, but I know I always go back to feeling sad and unmotivated. It never changes and I'm tired of existing. I wish I could die of an illness so that no one thinks my family failed to raise me. I've thought of just killing myself in some random area my parents will never be able to visit so that they never have to visit the site of my death. While it is expensive having to pay for my funeral expenses, I know it will be better than having to waste money on their useless child every single day that I continue to live."

Right before we got here, his central air/heating unit broke &amp; we can't afford to fix it. So we purchased window a/c units and, heaters for the colder months. We chip in for bills, so I don't have a problem with that. But, that's where the nice part ends. On the hottest days of the year, he was shutting the a/c units off, the ceiling fans too because, (as he puts it) there was no one in the room. It's hot as hell &amp; he shuts them off. Last month I took them out because it had gotten cooler out. Enter the heaters. We have two. One for the living room &amp; one for his bedroom. We're never really cold enough to want one. The trouble is, he seems to think that, he needs to crank up the heaters constantly when, it is 70 damned degrees out! He completely messed up the electrical outlets in the living room doing just that! I see no reason to have the living room one on at all, when he is in his room much less cranked up so high that, the outlets get red hot. I agreed to move here &amp; help so, that's on me. But, it's making me nuts. We can't go anywhere without him &amp; can't leave him alone for an extended amount of time because, he cannot walk well and, falls quite often. No matter how much we tell him, please don't go outside Dad, he does and, takes a chance of falling on the concrete porch. It's like dealing with a 94 year old, bratty, kid! We don't go anywhere or, do anything. Our love life is non existent and his habits are utterly DISGUSTING. The man consistently wipes his nose with the back of his hand at the dinner table &amp; insults my cooking by choosing frozen &amp; jarred foods over my homemade. Our children and, sole Grandchild live in different places with their respective spouses. One in Florida, one in N.Y. and one in N.J. We can't even make plans to go see them because Dad can't even make a 20 minute car ride to a fucking store! He rudely and, constantly interrupts me when I am in the middle of speaking, repeats the same boring shit, day in, day out and I have to eat it. I am beginning to resent him. He signed the house over to us last year and, is always telling us...THIS IS YOUR HOUSE NOW, CHANGE WHAT YOU LIKE. Then, complains when we suggest things. I am so damned depressed about this bullshit. Basically because I feel trapped. Why? Because he is giving us a house with a 70 grand mortgage attached. I have to swallow everything because of this shit and, I'm mentally, physically &amp; emotionally exhausted. Every time I mention anything to my Wife, we have an argument. To top it all off, two weeks ago I got a kidney stone and, the fucking thing won't pass! I've been on pain meds and, they make me feel shitty but, I have to take them otherwise, it's the worst pain ever. So, that's it in a nutshell. Maybe it isn't as depressing as some would think but, isn't feeling trapped with no way out enough after awhile? Peace out and love to all."
1130,depression,I just don‚Äôt know anymore,"This year has been rough I guess but mostly on a person to person level like I fell out of my most real relationship I ever had we were even about to get engaged and then one day she just told me she didn‚Äôt love me anymore. So I lost the love of my life, and that hurt a lot. I‚Äôm honestly still dealing with that pain and I‚Äôve tried to go on dates but nothing feels right anymore. Now however I‚Äôve had to have a friend break up, my best friend of 4 years and his gf and myself all moved into a place and from day one anything that was negative was my fault. The person that I knew as my best friend has changed so much in the last few months that I don‚Äôt even recognize that person anymore so we got into a huge fight and now I don‚Äôt see us ever trying to reconnect. Things we‚Äôre said on both ends thatll keep it that way. I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is the two most important connections I had in my life are gone now and I have no one now I just feel completely alone."

And now it‚Äôs been 2 days since we talked and part of me wants to believe him but part of me thinks he‚Äôs just saying that to reject me nicely.

And tonight I was cutting my thigh with a blade and thinking of him while I did it like wtf. What is wrong with me."

I moved out for the first time in may I can barely afford my half of rent. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to bring another life into this world and not even know if I can afford formula or diapers. I knew life wasn‚Äôt supposed to be fair but I honestly don‚Äôt even have motivation to be a father. I had so many aspirations to be something in my life, I feel like all that motivation I once had switched to a cold depression. I had so many examples of who not to be from uncles, aunties, hell both of my dads haven‚Äôt even been in my life emotionally. I just feel like I‚Äôm at a crossroads. To the right I have clear path on being a family man, being the father I never had, and on the left is just nothing but emptiness."

1135,depression,Help.,"Hello, I need some help. I just keep thinking that I‚Äôm never going to find love and never going to be successful.

So now that that's out of the way, does anyone have a resource I can use for someone I can talk to when I'm having one of those moments? I'm not looking for an emergency line or anything, more like someone, similar to a counselor, that I could reach out to for over the top moments like that.

I dont know if there is something like this, I just don't have anyone to talk to and especially during those moments I feel super isolated like all I can do is just feel hopeless and alone."

1139,depression,Feeling conflicted,"
My therapist thinks I have PTSD and I was diagnosed depression by my doctor. So I don‚Äôt know, I open up more to my therapist than my doctor. 
I have flashbacks of my bad childhood and severe anxiety even when interacting virtually, unwanted thoughts; disturbing thoughts, not wanting to hang with even close friends and just not interested. Trembling as well.

I am depressed but I feel so conflicted when a person says to me: ‚ÄúWhy do you LOOK so depressed?‚Äù. And that person already knows I am depressed yet continues to ask me for some reason, they asked me in hallway at school where a lot of people could hear. 
I could be making it a big deal but it is a big deal for me. I don‚Äôt know what to say when they ask me that, they also tell me I received bad genes, I play it off cool and laugh. I feel more hurt because I‚Äôm born from my parents, it‚Äôs like theyre insulting my parents.

They also smacked me on head really hard while walking in school. I instinctively hit them back and the person fell, I remember being really upset and just unwanted thoughts pouring in my head. I felt dizzy and sick later. 

I play it calm and cool but internally I‚Äôm just having disturbing thoughts like wanting to do this and that to the person, I feel ecstatic when thinking like that and then I feel so guilty and sad because even if they insult, they still have their life and it‚Äôs theirs. 

I sometimes end up thinking about it and end up crying for a few minutes before stopping and just staring off somewhere, I stop crying as if I never cried and enjoy my day. I also think it‚Äôs because of my eye bag that makes me look depressed, it‚Äôs just the ‚Äúwhy do you look depressed‚Äù makes me furious. 
I didn‚Äôt tell the school because I believe it‚Äôs just a small deal in general and I, me, being dramatic. 

Sometimes people tell me things will get better and me being me, I get my hopes up and believe it will but it doesn‚Äôt no matter the number of people that told me it will, no matter how much the pastor prayed I will. 
After time I grew sick of hearing that it‚Äôll get better, I felt sad and then angry. 

I even left behind the desperate young me who wanted affection and someone by my side, it was unintentional. I was so stressed and felt hopeless. 
I decided to join Reddit and share my thoughts. 
Feel free to share your experiences below and virtual hugs needed at this moment, a virtual hug is enough."

1141,depression,Tired.,"I‚Äôm just tired of everything. Tired of working long countless hours. Tired of faking a smile,  and hoping no one sees passed the part of me that enjoys making people laugh only to notice the darkness that lingers around me because I can‚Äôt trust anyone enough to let them see that side of me anymore. I just want the thoughts in my head to end."
1142,depression,I graduate college in 10 days.,"

Time and time again, I‚Äôve convinced myself I‚Äôd never get this far. I went into college during the worst depressive episode of my life. SH, insomnia, isolation, constant suicidal ideation. I‚Äôve been working fulltime since I started college, and pretty much have been in a consistent burnout for 5 years. I was poor, I was living without running water. I couldn‚Äôt afford groceries. My family was falling apart.
By the time I finished my first semester, I had a date, method, location planned. I had convinced myself no one would care that I was gone. That no one saw me struggling so they didn‚Äôt deserve to mourn me when I‚Äôm gone. I attempted but was nearly caught by someone before I could go through with it fully.  No one even knew until recently. I was going to make it look like an accident. 

A few weeks after my ‚Äúattempt‚Äù a work friend of mine was brutally murdered. It feels odd to say she saved my life, we hardly knew eachother deeply, I had zero profound impact on hers. But seeing her family mourn her tragic untimely death gutted me. I can still remember what her fathers cries sounded like, and she was twice my age. I told myself at her funeral that I simply wasn‚Äôt allowed to kill myself. She had the ability to live and raise her daughter stolen from her, it felt like I‚Äôd be doing wrong by her to forfeit mine. 

So I began the trials of enduring. Deciding I wasn‚Äôt going to kill myself didn‚Äôt make my mental health any better. In fact it got worse, many times. But it did get better at times too. I forced myself a babystep out of isolation, and my partner and friends pulled me the rest of the way out. I developed some half-decent coping mechanisms, I got better at vunerability and communication. But even with a loving partner supporting me, and trying to work on myself, I will eventually spiral back down into the dark. Into not doing my assignments, calling off work, letting the dishes in my sink rot, not brushing my teeth. A constant cycle of shame that builds exponentially upon itself. But in order for it to be a true cycle, it always has to come back around. 

I am officially 10 days from graduation. I think my freshmen self would be surprised to see me here. I‚Äôve come to terms with the fact that I am mentally ill. My happiness and ability to function exists as a cycle, and in order to survive I have to accept the fact that I will spend a lot of my time enduring instead of enjoying life. But it‚Äôs an objective fact that I have the capacity to feel healthy, happy, and alive. Because I‚Äôve experienced many fleeting moments of it over these years no matter how poorly I took care of myself, or how heavily I leaned into the darkness. No matter how bad it‚Äôs been, it‚Äôd be a lie to say it hasn‚Äôt gotten easier to manage. I‚Äôve been reflecting and I wanted to share some of the things that have kept me here. 

* Try to reverse the mindset that it‚Äôs ‚Äúalways going to get worse again‚Äù, . If you have the ability to feel depressed, you must have the ability to enjoy yourself as well. Everything in life is cyclical.

* Heal your inner child, talk to yourself and nuture yourself like you‚Äôre taking care of a child. Would you hit a child out of frustration? Would you neglect feeding a child, or force them to live in a filthy environment? Would you shame a child for their emotions? Of course not, so don‚Äôt  allow depression justify this abuse towards yourself.

* Find an unchanging reason to hold on. This one isn‚Äôt easy, and flexible reasons are fine too, but you want to have something you cant let go of. 

* Have back up plans instead of suicide: Psych wards and therapy are obvious and effective, but if you‚Äôve exhausted them already or don‚Äôt have access to them, have some impulsive change planned to scracth the itch of self destruction without ending yourself. Get that tattoo you‚Äôve always wanted, go off the grid and live off the land, buy a plane ticket to anywhere and explore. It is so easy to isolate yourself, but even if you hate the life your living, there‚Äôs got to be something more interesting than just dying. 

* Acknowledge you are ill. I know this one seems obvious, but for me it took me a long time to distinguish between shame and bitterness. I was bitter other people around me seemed to have it easier, jealously is a normal emotion. But the shame i placed upon myself for missing classes or school, not cleaning, having loor hygiene, etc was SO signifigant and made things so much worse. These were all symptoms of my illness.  A deaf person would not get mad at themselves for not being able to hear someone who continuously tried speaking to them and getting them to listen. They would be mad at the person not acknowleding their need for accomdations. It is not our fault the modern world does not accomodate our illness. It is not our fault we struggle, and it is natural to be jealous of those who don‚Äôt. 

I believe with the pressure of school out of my life, I may just be able to have proper time to start healing.  But I will be mentally ill regardless, and I am okay with that now. 

Wish me luck."

1145,depression,An increasingly strange feeling growing with time,"Been increasingly going through this feeling that there is something not right

No matter what I do, what I change, what I try to ignore, I can‚Äôt shake it. I honestly can‚Äôt remember the last time I‚Äôve gone a day without thinking about killing myself.

What‚Äôs most pathetic about me is that my environment around me isn‚Äôt bad, it‚Äôs just entirely mental for the most part. I can‚Äôt stop hating myself, I just can‚Äôt stop. I‚Äôve been cutting my thighs up so bad lately that I genuinely can‚Äôt count how many cuts are on me. 

I genuinely don‚Äôt know how much longer I can do this, how much longer I can continue faking everything to hide my depression. I‚Äôm to the point where I‚Äôm about to disappear, disconnect from everyone and everything and give myself one year to fix myself, and if I can‚Äôt.

It's just getting worse

I don't know how much longer I can put up with this, but I can take a well-educated guess.

Anyone know any good in-patient mental facilities (aka grippy sock jails) in London?"
1152,depression,I wish I could forget it all,"I wish I could forget it all. For as long as I have so many bad memories, I'll always be depressed to my core. The trauma, the guilt, the shame, the mistakes, the embarrassment. There's no single thing in my life that has gone so wrong that a person couldn't recover from it, but the sheer volume of painful thoughts leaves me feeling quite irreversably emotionally disabled. Where does it start and where does it end? It always has been and it's endless, and it keeps getting worse the more time goes by.

It sucks, I'm at a point in life where realistically, there's no way I can just turn things around and recover. I can only learn to live with the damage and accept my lowered expectations of myself. But with everything I've got going through my head now, I can't do the most basic things that can keep me on steady footing. It's looking real bad.

Recognizing how limited I am by decades long depression, I don't expect myself to keep going much longer - I really am concerened I won't have the will to live much longer. There's not much use in talking anymore about it. It's wait and see. If I make it through the next month or two, that'll be an accomplishment, but I'm nowhere close to doing anything spectacular to make lasting improvement to my current trajectory."
1153,depression,Cutting off emotional vampires,"Trigger warning: This topic discusses suicide.

At first, it's okay to say you're having these thoughts. It's brave. And people will not generally ghost or slow fade you if you come clean with these thoughts...ONCE. 

However, I have an acquaintance I met in a chronic pain subreddit who exchanged numbers with me and has, no lie, expressed suicidal ideation two dozen times in the last year. She has said it 3 times just this month. And I really fucking resent it. 

I am somebody dealing with depression, PTSD, addiction, and chronic pain myself. I deal with suicidal thoughts too, but when people ask how I'm doing, if I'm not well I simply dodge the question. I will not burden them over and over.

I am in no position to be somebody's therapist as I'm dealing with the same condition she is. I've spent countless hours offering ideas and she disregards all of it. She's petrified of getting worse, as am I. But I am risking it and putting my body through torture via multiple surgeries (4 this year) 

In that case, all she's doing is dumping on me, and here I am afraid to ghost her or say goodbye because what if that's the tipping point that sends her over the edge? I've never even met this person but can't bring myself to do it. But truth be told I do not want to talk to her anymore."

It takes me so much god damn effort to go about my day being productive and unwinding sustainably.  And all my phone wants me to do is keep scrolling, keep eyeballs locked to the content.  Keeps me from getting good sleep, keeps me from going outside more, from exercising more, from enjoying a book or practicing a new recipe.  

This fucking phone warps my reality, robs me of time and daylight, wastes my energy and focus.  I fucking hate it and i fucking hate that I'll never be able to abandon it because of all the ways this addiction is enabled and encouraged by my surroundings.  I hope I can get the high ground over this fucking thing before it kills me."

I mean in 50 years I'll be just as useless as I am now, so it's really hard to imagine anything being worth it. it's not like I deserve any good anyway though, I've been so useless at anything worth doing, just doing enough to get through because I'm so fucking lazy I can't commit to my own life. and I'm supposed to believe in God, who I've also let down. now I'm gonna be getting my first job at 20 years old and I somehow have to confront complete strangers on a daily basis if I get a retail job. this is supposed to be easy right? I've at least been trying, and dad asks me if I really want a job like I'm a motivated person? nah, I'll just put a few applications in and let everyone else pressure me in to actually progressing my life as usual. I know I'll have to get something done anyway, cos I won't be ending my own life any time soon, but my future is just invisible, like I know I'm gonna look back and realize that memories don't mean much at all? if nothing truly satisfies you, how do you just exist knowing nothings perfect?

Some days I feel like I'm absolute trash that doesn't deserve to live and other days I feel totally empty inside. I have a good idea of what would make my life finally feel good but I can't reach it. My dream is to fall in love, marry an amazing woman, have kids and live a normal life with my family. I'm nowhere near achieving this and I don't know how to fix this.


I'm a highschool dropout. The two main reasons on why that is because I have extreme social anxiety and I have always had trouble learning things. I've never been tested for learning disabilities as far as I know but I wouldn't be surprised if I had some. This is making it really difficult to find a job. Money doesn't buy you happiness straight up but it's necessary. I live with my mom and I'm thankful for not being kicked out on the streets but I'm so sick of mooching off her. I know I'm still young but 23 is an adult age yet I feel like a child still. I feel uneducated about most things in life including adult responsibilities. I just want to feel like a normal human and I'm sick of it.


I tried medicine for my social anxiety before and nothing ever had any effect on me so I gave it up. One day though I swallowed a whole bottle of Xanax and that day I attempted suicide in 2018 by jumping off a bridge. I thought about suicide the day before I took them so idk if it had any effect on what I thought. I didn't do research on it but I guess it wasn't high enough to kill me idk. I fractured lots of parts like my wrists, pelvis, leg and spine even. I was court ordered to have therapy after but it didn't do anything for me and I knew it wouldn't either as talking doesn't help me. I now have a 20k unpaid hospital bill due to my mistakes. Luckily I healed up okay over the years and my main issue now is my bad back. It hurts to bend over for too long or even stand for too long. Maybe if I was more active then I could make it feel better over time but I have no time to focus on that and it's harder for me. I started over eating after leaving the hospital for a couple years. I'm not in the worst situation but I now weigh 180 at 5'6. I always had issues with my looks before but now I want to puke when seeing myself in the mirror. All my weight has gone into my face and belly. 


I have issues with my diet because I have terrible taste buds. I cannot eat fish, vegetables, most fruits and much more without gagging, almost vomiting or actually vomiting. I used to at least give some things a try when I was a little younger even if it was still hard but now I just simply look at something and my brain tells me ""don't eat it"". I'm incredibly picky with the stuff I do like too like I can eat chef boyardee spaghetti but home made or restaurant is disgusting. I like chicken from restaurants but I hate grocery store chicken. I only eat white meat and it has to be boneless. I could go on but it's easier to say that my diet is just Mac and cheese and pizza. I think I've given up on trying to eat healthy and it would be fine by me if I could lose the weight in another way but I just can't right now. I've tried fasting before and it works but only if I workout with it. I haven't worked out since my surgeries and I can't really try either because I have issues with my feet right now and my back hurts really bad. 


I have really bad ingrown toenails right now that I can't really take care of because I have no insurance anymore and I really don't want another huge hospital bill. They affect my life pretty significantly. I haven't left my house in 3 years because I can't even wear shoes without them bleeding. I also self diagnosed myself with Trichotillomania as I pull my hair out constantly every day all day. I also have lots of mini mental issues like I have a big fear of all bugs and even loud noises. I can't even take a crap in peace if anyone is near by and I need a fan or faucet running to drown out the noise. I have issues thinking of proper words to say during conversation and I'm even very forgetful about lots of things in my life. I applied for Medicare and was denied and even tried to apply for disability close after leaving the hospital. Could barely make it through the, I guess mental/social test because of my social anxiety. My voice was so shakey and I couldn't look the man in the eyes and I was about to burst into tears just talking with him about normal things. The physical test made me test my blood pressure and as usual it was through the roof they even made sure it was right by testing it multiple times and using other equipment and had others test it to. After that it was literally 2 minutes before they said I was good to go. I was asked to stretch and bend over and here I am sounding like an old man and I was in pain yet they thought I was fine. They based it off of 2 minutes. I felt so upset because it took so much courage for me to leave my house and go through that type of thing.


I know this is disgusting but I had my first shower in about a year a couple days ago. I can't seem to even find motivation to hop in the shower anymore because I just don't care and I also don't want to go through the pain of bending over and trying to clean hard to reach places on my body. My toes always end up worse than they looked before after a shower too. Luckily I had a LDR relationship for 2 years so they couldn't smell me but she recently broke up with me. Not surprising with the life I live but that almost destroyed me and I thought about killing myself but got lucky by quickly finding someone else that understood my garbage life. Im currently dating another girl that's across country but I know it's just going to end the same way because it's a group effort to save money to end up together in the end. I make no money so how can I even think about dating when it just won't work. Romance is the only part of my life that makes me happy but I can't keep it.


I had a small burst of motivation that lasted I dunno maybe 2 hours to take a practice GED test. Forgot and failed every thing even basic math. Tried to read the explanations on the answers and it just hurt my head so badly that I had to stop. I can't seem to learn things like that as it just goes through one ear and out the other. I never studied before as a kid either because it just never did anything for me. I'm afraid I'll never find work without my GED though so idk what to do.


I really have no idea what my point is here besides just sharing every shitty detail of my life but what I know is that I just want to feel like a normal person. All I do every day is watch TV and sometimes play video games. I have no other hobbies or things that interest me. I feel like the worst person on earth sometimes and I really don't know why I continue to live. I have the motivation to want to work and make lots of money to slowly fix parts of my life like having my own place, car, buying what I want and need. It would also help my dream of being together with my loved one and I could even finally buy presents for everyone near Christmas time. The issue is I can't even do that because of all my other issues getting in the way. I have no idea what I should do to start fixing my huge mess of a life. I really have feelings for my girlfriend but she's been hinting that if I can't find work soon then we'll probably not be together long. She has a beautiful heart and accepted everything else I shared with her and I don't blame her for thinking that. I've been thinking that if I lose her then I'll probably just kill myself because I'm tired of my shitty life. What do I do? is there someone out there that can help me? I really don't think there is."
1165,depression,Why is world so scary,"I finally go outside of house after a vert long long time. All i can see and meet now is only rudeness and toxic.
Now i may know the feeling of helpless person who commits suicide and the perspective of a person who hates society. I don't know what to do."
1166,depression,"when i‚Äôm out i wanna go back home, when i‚Äôm home i wanna go out","Idk if this is the right place to post this, anyways, as the title says i always have this feeling when i go out with my friends where i really regret going and i really want to go back home, and when i decide not to go out i feel like i should go, but as soon as i‚Äôm there i regret it. what is it?"
1167,depression,I‚Äôm pushing everyone away,"I fucking deserve it. I‚Äôm a worthless piece of shit anyway. I‚Äôd rather leave first then them , it hurts less that way. I deserve to be alone. Im a burden to everyone to the point where everyone just resents me the more they get to know me. I hate myself so much. This whole year didn‚Äôt go as planned *at all* I didn‚Äôt accomplish anything. I‚Äôve only gotten worst."

1170,depression,Why can I cut myself anymore without feeling anything?,"Im cutting myself again and i dont know what to do anymore, everyone  and everything seem to go down hill my only friend who gave a shit about me and made me think life was live worthy dropped me and no longer want to do anything with shit , I thought I really made a friend it hurts so much how I‚Äôm only reminded of her when i have  my suicidal thoughts. Im on the verges of ending myself so badly with out dealing with myself or my stupid emotions."
1171,depression,I want to run away and start a new life,"I am a 28F I fell in love with a guy, last year he proposed me and we are engaged now. I love him a lot but I feel overwhelmed from his family. He's an extrovert and I'm an introvert. We both are from India and live in US, but he eventually wants to move back to India and live with his parents but I don't want to. We are complete opposites. We had quite a fights about these but it always ends in him saying - ""You never told me this before, and you liked my family before, now you are acting weird"". On top all this, I have lost my job and am not able to find one since a year as am always depressed about it. And Ive grown up in a toxic family, nothings ever a simple conversation in my family. Almost everything is riddled with passive aggression, subliminals, trauma and projection. And they dont care about me. From all this I have this constant urge to run away from everybody and be on my own."
1172,depression,I‚Äôm a burden in everyone‚Äôs life,"Every friend or family member I‚Äôm close to tries to help me, but I never get any better. They try to offer me advice, they try to distract me from my pain, they try to be there when I need them, but I know that they‚Äôre sick and tired of trying to make me better. People can only tolerate my bullshit for so long and then they either expect a noticeable improvement or they don‚Äôt want to deal with me anymore. I wish I could be better. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt know that I want to be better. I want to be happy. I want to feel good about myself. I want all of those things, but I seem to be irreparably broken. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many times someone gives me healthy advice or encourages me, I always stay the same. I don‚Äôt want to bother people anymore so more often than not I shove my feelings down because I know nobody wants to hear about how shitty I‚Äôm doing for the millionth time. It doesn‚Äôt help that a lot of my problems are things that are out of my control. I know that I cannot control the actions of others, only myself, so it hurts when I need something from other people and have no way of getting it. Not to even get started on the reality that what I need most is to love myself (which I hate as an idea because it sounds tremendously clich√© and because I don‚Äôt know how to do it)."

1174,depression,I‚Äôm ruining my future,"Last week, one of my friends barged into my house and tried to force myself to go to school.

I haven‚Äôt been going even though I know I have to. I honestly do try so hard to make it, but every morning I end up sobbing on my bathroom floor over nothing. The simple thought of waking up the next morning is even tough to think about.

I used to be such a good student, taking AP and honors classes and passing all of them with As and Bs while also being in numerous clubs and being on sports teams. I had a whole plan and was preparing myself for college and a career after that. I used to be ambitious and motivated as my future was so important to me.

Now I can‚Äôt even imagine myself being successful as I used to. That same friend doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôll even go to college anymore. 

I haven‚Äôt done homework in weeks. I quit the sports team I‚Äôm in even though it‚Äôs one of the things I love the most. I had to because I wasn‚Äôt even able to get myself up and go to practice. I‚Äôm preparing to get kicked out of the only club I‚Äôm in because I‚Äôm not involved enough. I‚Äôm a bum. 

I know I did this to myself, but I can‚Äôt seem to get out of this loop. I‚Äôm so terribly disappointed. I have nothing anymore. No hope, no future, no motivation, nothing.

I‚Äôve isolated myself from my friends and pushed new ones from becoming close with me. 

Everything that I am upset with now is all my fault. So I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so hard for me to try to fix. 

I don‚Äôt even feel as if I have a valid reason to be acting this way. I‚Äôm privileged as fuck and shouldn‚Äôt have anything to complain about. So why do I feel so shitty? I don‚Äôt know.

Looking for advice"
1175,depression,Wasted youth and life,"I spent so many years failing to be a man.  I allowed myself to be stepped on, pressured to do things I didn't want to,  and wither away. I wish I didn't listen to my family.  I wish I didn't let myself be disrespected by peers. I wish I made choices for myself instead of avoiding confrontation from my family or society. I wish I lived for myself instead of others. 

The formative years of my life are gone. I will never have them back.  I should have been educated in many areas of life but I haven't.  I'm no better than I wasat 18. My maturity and intellect is low,  so is my life experience.  I wasted the years I had to become someone I could accept. 

Instead I'm a loser with nothing going for him.  I see no point in looking forward because I've already strayed too far off any path worth traveling"
1176,depression,"If / When you wish to be social, what comes to mind for conversation?","Title as a legitimate question. I could ask this wherever, for a general populace, but I am honestly curious for answers specifically from those who might be / are depressed in their lives. Sure there's trying to get to know somebody, but I see that as slightly different.

So, anything for conversation, specific or not? Should it be as simple as ""hey did you see the game last night"" or weather talk, until random spouts of inspiration as to theories about the enigma of the universe, or... what ideas come to your mind?

I ask for a few reasons, but it'd be boring to list 'em. I'll probably delete this post in the morning out of anxiety and embarrassment, I don't expect any response. Being social can be very difficult in any capacity, not just for myself. G'day to ya &amp; thank you for your time."
1177,depression,It does get better,"After fighting Clinical Depression, PTSD, Anxiety issues for more than 2.5 years. I need this to convey everyone that it does get better and no, life doesn‚Äôt end there and all those medicines you thought would be bad and ruin the little life you have? Thats hoax too, we criticise medical world too much while we try to build this ‚Äúorganic‚Äù life of ours. 

When I was about 16, this disease started taking a hold of me. I must say there could be a graphical representation of this, and growth is gradual. From the onset of your disease, the first time you thought you want to commit suicide; it may take about 2-3 years as usual to reach the peak point where you realise that you have a mental disorder. 

 Now not everyone has the money or time to visit a therapy but you can get medicines at-least, and the side effects are nothing as compared to the side effects of depression itself. So it is better to start your treatment instead of visiting that suicidal thought everyday. 

Furthermore, not every depression is genetic, not every depression occurs without any reason, so try to find the root cause of it (if any) like financial issues, relationships, childhood trauma and abuses and deal with those issues simultaneously.

Also physical activities like gymming or going out for a walk, spending time near natural beauty like mountains and forests, going for random rides while listening to your playlist help to cope with it. 

Conclusively, it will get better. Just take that one step towards betterment, don‚Äôt doubt yourself and you will find the path forward."
1178,depression,i wish,i wish anyone cared. i just wish i was truly loved. that i didnt have to chase people who always hurt me. im so tired. i just want someone to truly love me and care for me and won't get tired of me because of my symptoms. someone who understands. someone i can feel at peace with when im around. so that i dont have to have a constant guard up. no one i ever met made me feel that way. and it hurts so much. i dont want to live anymore. because no one will save me. and i need to be saved. im too tired. i am always abused and i jjust want to be at peace and loved.

1181,depression,I just wanna kill myself so badly,Even though people have depression I always feel like its never like mine..  I see so many people here talk about relationships and shit. No woman would ever like me due to depression and being an ugly fuck. If you think otherwise you just have no clue. Depression took everything from me. Im soulless. I think I died in another dimension and this is my remains or some shit. Theres no life in me.. just a dead empty shell. I will die a virgin and God if I had a gun I think I'd do it
1182,depression,i dont get why people argue against suicide,listen i know death hurts the people witnessing it but it is the choice of the person doing it. suicide is a choice that is okay the world sucks already we all have the choice to give up on all that pain an suffering

This is the second time in the last months that I woke up and feel deeply lonely, depressed and anxious at the same time. I just don't know why.
I have not the force or the will to tell my whole story, it would take too much and nobody really cares. 
I just needed to let it out somewhere and Reddit is the first thing that came up in my mind. Started crying without a reason (I have never been a guy who cries easily).
I have talked to my dad and he said ""don't worry it's okay, we will do anything we can to fix this"". He thinks it's because of an exam I have in few days. Maybe it is but I've never felt that way in the past. I've never got depressed because of an exam and I'm sure the exam is just the trigger, but there something more inside me. A monster who is trying to catch me and I'm exhausted of running and running and running.. 
I am thinking to seek help to psychologist. 
I don't feel myself anymore, I am losing my identity and this scares the fuck out of me. Sometimes I have suicidal thoughts, but I always managed to ""control"" this really bad thoughts. I have no energy. I don't know why. 
Sorry for my English, it is not my mother-language. And sorry for this post, I feel so miserable .."

1187,depression,Feeling down,"I just feel so down right now. I have no motivation to get out of bed, everything feels the same and things that used to bring me joy are just becoming boring. I‚Äôm losing the will to keep going, and I just want to quit trying. I feel like I should be sad, but I just don‚Äôt feel anything at all. I don‚Äôt know why either, as everything in my life is more or less fine. I can‚Äôt honestly tell if it‚Äôs just a phase of my life where it‚Äôs hard or if I‚Äôm bordering being clinically depressed. Does it end up getting better without treating it or should I try to do something about it? That being said I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do."
1188,depression,A rant about relationships,"The first relationship I was in ended in my partner cheating on me. It wasn't a very serious relationship; it didn't hurt much. The next relationship I would go on to have would end in them breaking up with me after a few weeks to instead be friends (which I'm fine with). 

But a few days ago I asked a girl for some relationship advice. I wanted to ask her out but I didn't want to ask her out just yet. I also told her that I was absolutely terrified of going to my school's winter formal but I wanted to go to make the other person happy. 

She started being very intrusive and aggressive about how she asked who the other person was. I tried a number of different ways to tell her that I didn't want to tell her who I liked. I had known that she liked me but I just wasn't quite ready for a relationship (and now I doubt the idea of a relationship more). 

I had realised that she was kind of manipulative. I know she has always struggled with anxiety and depression and it doesn't look like she's got the greatest support from people in her life. Her last boyfriend was abusive and manipulative. 

Sorry for this post, it's essentially just a rant. If you have any advice or questions I'd be happy to hear it."
1189,depression,just end it,im done i want it all to end . I dont want to be on this earth anymore its just pointless .

I've gone through every fucking professional process for help it's all useless on me - maybe I'm not really part of the human race? Maybe I'm just reacting healthily to that fact? Maybe there's some kind of cosmic reason for me never fitting in and always being miserable I dunno what to do"
1191,depression,Stay Strong People,"To anyone reading this, stay strong and fight the good fight.  There are different sources for depression:  our own regrets, lacking things in life... remember, we ALL have done the best with the knowledge we had at the time.  In hindsight we can see clearly how we messed things up, but we must learn from our mistakes.   For other reasons such as having bad parents or bad living situations:  remember, you did not chose your parents or the situations you are in.  One never would.   

Get in touch with yourself and your own connection to the divine.  You don't have to believe in a religion or any God...  just believe in that inner strength you have, take each day at a time and learn from it.

We are all going to have those weak moments, but please never take the ""easy"" way out...  for we never know what happens tomorrow."

1195,depression,Advice on Doing Basic Activities Again?,"I‚Äôm seeking advice on how to get myself to start doing things again. My most recent bout of depression (sparked by full covid lockdown and my mother being really ill/almost dying) has made it so it was all I could do to complete my assignments for uni (with many extensions). I had no energy left to do anything else or see anyone. I‚Äôve barely left the house these past two months, probably only once in the past 5 weeks. 

Now that I‚Äôve finished my courses, I know what I need to start doing to move forward. I need to get outside, get some exercise, see and talk to friends again, etc. but I honestly have no desire to. If anything, I have a desire not to. All I want to do is sleep, lie in bed, and occasionally scroll through reddit or watch Netflix. 

How do I motivate myself? I‚Äôve tried breaking it down into small steps but even walking to the end of my street doesn‚Äôt seem feasible (even though I‚Äôm physically able to). Does anyone have any suggestions? 

I‚Äôve been in therapy consistently for the past year and a half and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm getting much out of it anymore. I‚Äôve been in and out of therapy for the past 10 years and I‚Äôve reached a point with my last two psychologists where there‚Äôs nothing they can tell me/suggest that I don‚Äôt already know. They‚Äôve basically said so themselves (it helps that I come from a psych background myself). I‚Äôve also been on a variety of antidepressants with varying degrees of success.

I know what I need to do to move forward but how do I actually go about doing it?

Also should probably mention that I have no family even remotely nearby (they live overseas) and only a few weak friendships locally so I don‚Äôt have any close contacts who can help me."
1196,depression,i miss home,"i hate college. i want to go home so bad. i want to just hug my parents and go on a drive.

1197,depression,I am so done,"I literally am unable to have friends outside of secretly hiding some at school from my mom. I cant hang out or do anything (before y‚Äôall fucking start I can‚Äôt do anything I‚Äôm a minor and if I could I would have done shit already if I leave I will get called in as missing and get a beating.) 

My grades has gone to shit, I literally won‚Äôt be able to graduate. I need to so I can at least be able to get a good job to pay for plastic surgery to at least look better but no I just have to have crippling depression. I have tried losing my weight and never succeeding because I go straight back to self loathing which leads to binging. 

Holy shit I just want to be skinny, have a social life, get good grades and be able to actually feel loved and supported my my family but no I just have to be the one to have to release my trauma and break the generational curse. I am truly broken if anyone had the guts to love me an ugly person like me they would be dissatisfied because I truly don‚Äôt think I can express anything other that sadness anymore."

1200,depression,Seriously just going to kill myself,"I don't care anymore, nothing fucking matters.

No friends or anything, try talking to people online and they ghost me, try talking to people in person and they seem so uninterested i just stop.

I can literally scroll for almost for 3 full seconds through all the people who ""wanted"" to be friends, the page has to load twice to even have them all on screen.
And trying to talk to more people just adds to the list as no matter what they just stop responding randomly or slowly just ignoring me while being clearly active...


I hate myself, I'm ugly, I'm stupid, and it's been proven to me time and time again I'm not worth anything at all.

I hate being alive so much it hurts, talking helps but now it's like I just worry every message is the last one they're ever going to send.

Nobody will read this either I know, I guess I'm just typing this because it use to help foo.

I don't want pity, I don't want anything anymore, there's no getting better, and I'm just going to die like this and literally not even knowing what it feels like to hug someone lmao 

It doesn't matter anymore, the only thing giving me literally anything to keep going is dumbass fictional stuff...

I'm just gonna end it, soon I don't care anymore, I'm tired"
1201,depression,Taking sertraline now and experiencing side effects,"Specifically feeling loopy. Like I'm floating or aware that I'm me but also feel like I'm not inside my body. I don't know. It feels weird.

I can manage the nausea, drowsiness and dry mouth but I'm kinda anxious about feeling loopy since I've also experienced this when I was taking pregabalin for anxiety and it scared me so much.

Is this normal? Any tips on how to manage feeling like this? I'm still in day 3 of taking it. I know I have to wait at least a month to see the effects. Just feeling really anxious coz I don't want to feel worse than I am already."

1204,depression,I am tired.,"From the bottom of my heart, I am tired.

I am tired of trying to perfect things.
I am tired of stressing over things that are out of my control.
I am tired of stressing about everything.
I am tired of worrying.
I am tired of having no motivation to do the things I need to do.
I am tired of having no motivation to do anything at all.
I am tired of dealing with these thoughts.
I am tired of dealing with this body.
I am tired of showering and taking care of myself.
I am tired of obsessing over my weight.
I am tired of feeling fat and ugly.
I am tired of worrying that I am not good enough.
I am tired of loving people who will never love me back.
I am tired of being lonely.
I am tired of sabotaging my relationships. 
I am tired of trying to change.
I am tired of feeling all of these emotions.

I am tired of being human. I am tired of being alive. I am tired of everything.

I don‚Äôt want this anymore, but I don‚Äôt want to end my life. I just want to be put in a sleep without end, and dream about what I want."
1205,depression,I will be graduating next semester with an engineering degree but I feel like a failure and a loser.,"I just want to rant. Might delete it later. 

I (21F) will be graduating next semester with an engineering degree and a decent GPA. I may have done well in my classes and academically but I feel like a biggest failure and loser. It‚Äôs getting hard to pull myself together. 

I was a loser in high school as well. Thought things would get better in college but Covid made it worse. I have received nothing but rejection in my life; rejection from internship, rejection from jobs, rejection from relationships (I got rejected on January when I confessed to a guy I had crush on. He gave me mixed signals. Thought he liked me but guess not), and rejection from self. 

Next semester I will be graduating with no job, no experience, no internship, no friends, and no boyfriend.I don‚Äôt even have any close friends or relatives to share my thoughts with. I have tried talking to some of my closest friend/relative but i have either been judged or called as dramatic/cringe. 

And the scar of being sexually abused multiple times by my own cousin at the age of 14, keeps hitting back. 

I currently work at retail and it makes me even more depressed. Slowly losing hope in life.
I try to make myself strong but it‚Äôs just getting harder and harder. I have no motivation to do anything anymore."
1206,depression,There‚Äôs always the empty feeling left at the end of the day.,Do you ever have days where everything is great and you're excited and engaged and like your actual self and then that kind of drifts away and disappears as the evening comes and then it's fucking 1am and you feel mediocre but you also feel bad for feeling mediocre because you have no reason to fucking feel mediocre.

1208,depression,What if I don‚Äôt love anyone in this world?,[removed]
1209,depression,When you have realized that everything is pointless there is no way to go back.,"Most people believe that depression is an irrational feeling that comes from chemical imbalance or traumatic experiences. That if you improve your life you will see things different. And if this doesn't work then a pill will solve your problem.

But I don't feel this way. I feel that everything depresses me, everything to my eyes seem bad. Relationships, families, society everything. Sometimes I feel I'm envy about things but then I think if I would be really happy if I had all these things I wish for. And I understand that I wouldn't.

I'm tired of life. Not about my own life that it's objectivly crap but life in general. Life is unfair, is cruel. Nobody has values or morals or goals everyone tries to find easy pleasures just to cope. Others like me just live in their misery completely isolated because they can't fool themselves. Others are still ignorant, try to be the best people, follow the rules and be hopeful. I'm jealous not for theur life but for their ignorance. They are not aware.

I don't want to hear crap anymore ""that life is difficult but has good times"", ""life is supposed to be harsh this is how we learn"", ""if you are a good person and treat other with the respect you want them to treat you, you will receive what you deserve"", ""sooner or later everyone will take what they deserve"". 

Enough really. I don't expect all my life be full of rainbows but seriously why to continue? To find a miserable job, doing a miserable family, living a miserable routine and feel happy that I will go to a crappy place for the weekend? Or partying all day, dying drugs, sex and not have a goal or a dream to follow? Maybe I'm weird, maybe I ask too much. Maybe what I want doesn't exist.

Life is not a movie. OK we get it. But if is not a movie why to stay here? To suffer? Since my life will never be how I dream it why not just go? Why to be saved?

I don't want to be fixed. There isn't anything to fix. I don't have problem with who I'm. I'm just aware that I don't fit in. And not for the reasons you think."
1210,depression,Why is it worse at night?,"I don‚Äôt understand. Why is my depression worse at night? I want to sleep, but the thoughts in my head don‚Äôt let me. Or I don‚Äôt let myself. I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt want to keep relying on alcohol or pills to knock me out, but it‚Äôs getting harder to resist.

Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm locked in my own head. It‚Äôs me and this brain 24 hours a day. I cant run from it or tell it to stop. I just want to be happy and free from it.

Does anyone else suffer worse at night?"
1211,depression,I'm being such a hypocrite,"I'm always pushing my friends around and talking over them. I will get frustrated if they cut me off in a conversation but then I start talking over them.
I don't know why I do this.
I know I do it when I do it but I can't seem to stop myself. I'm an impatient person so maybe it's because I have to wait for them to finish??
I feel like they can't share how they feel about what I do because it's just become normal. I want them to point it out. But I know that if they do that I'll feel even worse about myself.

I wish that I could just stop. I don't know why I can't. I've lost friends because of my behavior. I don't know who to ask.
I've never actually opened up to someone. Nobody knows how to help me stop because I never share anything. I don't feel deserving of any sort of help I guess. I feel like I should just waste away.
This is all affecting my performance at school too.

I just want HELP. I can't seem to accept it though. I want to treat the people close to me with respect and fairness. I want them to feel comfortable asking me to stop something."
1212,depression,Does it frustrated you when your other family members enjoying their life?,"I‚Äôm not trying to be an ass about wanting to ruin their happiness or whatever. Although, I‚Äôm happy, but at the same time I‚Äôm sad.

Imagine walking out my bedroom everyday, wanting to hang out with them but found out it‚Äôs empty, and never got to talk with them until I stopped coming out.

Anyways, I‚Äôd love to hear your stories :)"
1213,depression,Today was terrible and tomorrow will be terrible,I‚Äôm overwhelmed by school and work. I have not felt happy for several weeks now. I live in a new area (I moved during the pandemic) so I have no friends. A good day at this point is when I just feel numb. The worst part is that it seems like this is just what life is meant to be like from now on.
1214,depression,I want to vent out...,"Hello Everyone!   
I honestly don't know if I am depressed or just sad.   
I had 3 test I found on google about if I am depressed or not and it scared the shit out of me the test says that I am depressed but I know like I don't know they say never believe it not unless you go to the doctor right.  


Lately I thought I was just being lazy but I am not like before. I am a stay at home wife before I clean the house like almost everyday depends on what's on schedule but now I haven't been cleaning the house. I don't even take a bath as much as before, I am trying to take a bath everyday but it seems like everything is just too much right now. Even washing the dishes I just let it sit in the sink and when it smells I got no choice but to clean it sometimes that doesn't even bother me I just throw the water and put water with soap so that it wouldn't smell but sometimes I feel productive like folding the clothes one day productive and other days I don't even want to move.

1216,depression,16 Years Old and depressed,"I have never made a Reddit post before but I found this depressed forum and wanted to share my story. I‚Äôm 16 years old and have never really had trouble making friends. I‚Äôve never had a best friend or a close friend however that never really bothered me that much until this year when I lost all my friends and have felt so lonely. Im too nice of a person to take up for myself and let people walk right over me and call me names and i don‚Äôt do anything about it. I have always had trouble learning in school because I have adhd and learning disabilities which makes school very difficult. This stresses me out because I have never gotten good grades even if I try my hardest so it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I don‚Äôt try anymore. My grades are too bad and I feel like it‚Äôs too late to fix them.   Since my grades have been so poor I feel like have no future ahead of me. The teachers have called me names like idiot, moron, worthless, and a failure. This took place at a private Christian school where people think nothing bad happens there. When I was there it was filled with bad influences. School got so stressful for me that I ran away from home and my parents ended up calling the police on me about this. I‚Äôve always felt like a failure because I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend and I have never really accomplished anything huge. I‚Äôm not very shy but I‚Äôm a very awkward person. There was this one girl at my school that I would talk to every day and I liked her for 3 years. I would go home and think about her all day. After 3 years I decided to make the decision to tell her I like her. After I did that she said she wanted to stay friends and I was fine with that. The next day I came to school her friends were making fun of me and she never talked to me since. After all these events happening I fell into depression and it has ruined my life. I lost all my friends because I don‚Äôt even talk to anyone anymore. I have switched schools and it has just gotten me more stressed out and I don‚Äôt see me making friends with anyone there because it‚Äôs a very small school. I am now taking medicine for this depression I have and it seems to only make me feel worse. I don‚Äôt know what to do about this anymore I sure hope I‚Äôm not the only one facing stuff like this."

1219,depression,A story I guess,"My depression made me realized how detached I am to people. I always live life watching other people live I've hardly ever thought of my own existence. 2 weeks ago I was assigned  a essay on what is one thing wished we could had  stop from happening. The assignment was related to a book were reading in class and a moral in the book. We didn't have any prompts or anything because it was based on our real lives. At first I half assed it but then realized it's a project and a test grade so wrote about my long battle against mental illness because well it's the first regret that I thought . While I was writing I realized how peculiar my way of life is . How I cope with my emotions to how  I express them. My teacher had skimmed through our essays to pick and choose who would present theirs that day it was the last day of presenting and I was up to read . I didn't really have any emotions in it until I reached a paragraph on my longing for a interesting identity someone lovable or hatable and I neared the end of the paragraph and I read out a line "" if I'm That boring just turn me into something that you love . and when you get bored of me I'm pretty easy to replace so just throw me away  "" and I cant tell if it was just me but the room seemed more sad when I read out that line my English teachers face seemed depressed as well .  They essay wasn't that emoinal but that line kinda hit everyone in the room even the ones she weren't listening . I felt like I was 100 football fields away from everything  now when I go in that class I'm like a rare animal in a zoo being stared at and talked about right in front of me the teacher finds excuses not to call on me it's like I'm excluded which is fine I'm not mad about it.it's just well i dont know just weird"

2 of my friends were there trying their hardest to stop me and im feeling really guilty making them worry abt me"
1223,depression,Idk just need to speak and not face repercussions,"No matter what my life is at good or bad or whatever everything just hurts. My brain feels rotted my souls feels rotted, there‚Äôs little left of what I was and am, there is no foreseeable life ahead of me. Those around me have no idea the extent to which I am gone and to what lengths I‚Äôm willing to go each night to punish myself to make myself feel better. All I have is a relationship, the only reason I‚Äôm not in the ground now, but i can‚Äôt make her happy without ruining myself. She‚Äôs all I ever wanted she‚Äôs everything I‚Äôve cared for since we‚Äôve met years ago and she has been the only thing that has shielded me from myself. But my color break through and I have to say something about how I feel, I disagree with this she does or, don‚Äôt like that about what she does, or there‚Äôs something she does that hurts me but doesn‚Äôt care and then it‚Äôs always me ending up to blame because if I say anything about something she is involved with she gets upset at me and it hurts. It hurts so much to have the only thing you love seem to hate you at these times. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I think about it all the time but I just can‚Äôt because I have to try to take care of her and I can‚Äôt leave her thinking it‚Äôs her fault because it‚Äôs me not her doing this. I feel like I‚Äôm too much for her or anyone to handle anymore, she‚Äôs an angel trying to pry the devils hands off of me but I cannot be saved. My soul is blackened my mind is shackled to the bad and my willingness to live grows ever so smaller each day. I weep as I lay in the still of each night, away from her, there is nothing to block out my thoughts, but the hope of returning to her where I haven‚Äôt upset her or made her resent me keeps me from achieving peace. I feel sometimes a persons fate is doomed, that I and I‚Äôm sure others are just this way from our birth and that our suffering is simply the nature of our existence. I loathe for the memory of nothing, the thought of nothingness and the solitude of death, but I still hold onto her each day and it all vanishes, briefly. But what happens when I upset her too much, when all that is left of her protection of me is what she once said but the truth is she wants to turn her back and leave. I wish to finally relive myself of myself but what if there‚Äôs still that bit in me that believes she cares, but I search for it and nothings there, then I‚Äôm in the pain I was in before, no help, nothing to stop me except hope. That was the most painful, the hope. Maybe someone would come along, they didn‚Äôt. Until she did, but I was already past the point of return, when you can‚Äôt stand to see yourself you aren‚Äôt meant to be here anymore. I want peace but I can‚Äôt do it, I wish I had it in me, but I love her too much, despite the fact she hates me when she makes me feel worse at times."

I'm feel like everyday I just get closer to not knowing what to do with myself anymore. I don't know where to start to be entirely honest. So much has happened to over the years that they fall out of order, blur and meld with each other. And I'd be here all day..

Every time I try to pursue something it just blows up in my face. Art is something that I'm decently good at, but I know that I am not where I should be. My parents just took no interest in who I wanted to be..  
 I've tried making many video games that all fail. I even tried throwing what money I had at he problem with no dice.  
 I work at a dead end job, I can barely afford rent and I even managed to get a deal.. I would find another job.. but everything is just the same dead end retail/customer service horse shit.   
I met a girl that I really fell for, I mean just we click across the board. She started dating someone else within those 2 years anyway. It hurts a million times more to know that she wanted to but didn't want to risk making things awkward if things fell through.

Happiness is just extremely few and far between. 

I'm tired and there's pain o' plenty.. I just don't know what to do. I'm just taking it day by day, with hope that I just roll snake eyes and say ""peace out""."
1225,depression,how can i make food taste good again,"I've had depression since I was a teen (I'm 28 now) and have been professionally diagnosed with it, anxiety, PTSD, ADHD, and borderline. Sometimes when I'm really low I don't want to eat but food still tastes good even if I don't manage to eat a lot of it. But now it tastes bad.

All of it.

I did some googling and I guess stress and depression can make food taste bad. I keep gagging with most bites but I know I have to eat so I eat as much as I can manage. The only time it doesn't taste bad is if I douse it in hot sauce (following izombie rules here) and I can hardly finish my serving even then.

Please help. It's never gone this far before. I'm more stressed and bottling things up than ever bc my dad died and even though I didn't like him, I have to be strong for everyone. I can't sleep and now food tastes bad and I just want to disappear. I even gag on my medication"

But I can‚Äôt stop doing education because if I did that my child pension that I‚Äôm living in from my dad would stop.  And I‚Äôm sorta left feeling depressed and crappy and unmotivated. 

have a partner who I love and it‚Äôs a healthy relationship and all the rest but because. I kept on messing up during sex last night Like small mistakes that everyone makes, or even just things. Like I can‚Äôt help. I wanted to cry, like I don‚Äôt know what I can get to have my libido come back a bit.  But like yeah. Shit like last night keeps it down and,  I feel evil for being like that I say sorry when I don‚Äôt feel able to have sex and what not.

She asks ""is that car still giving [mom] trouble?"" Shes been dead for over 4 years. Someone has to inform her, and when she is, she bursts into tears and then in a couple minutes, she forgets, and stops crying. And my father beats me and says ""if you tell anyone, I will kill you."" Luckily he doesn't know my reddit account. Even though he beats me, I still love him no matter the circumstance. My step-mom also hates me, but not the same as my dad does. I've been taking beatings from him for god knows how fucking long. I'm so tempted to grab a knife and slit their throats while they sleep, or do it to myself. I've moved away from them though. And my roommate will ask me about the scars on me. I don't know what to tell her. I don't want her to know.

I want to try. I wanted to try. I decided that I wasn't going to college, then I started to think about giving it a chance though it would have to be community college, and I don't even have the money to go there. Even then what would I study? I'm already a senior in highschool, been hopeless the entire 4 years here. Then I started to panic 
I panicked because even if I planned it out and seemed well maybe I'd never even go along with it which is so sad. It always makes me cry because I can never go along with things. Even when I plan them ahead of time. I feel physically and mentally incapable of doing any of this because I go into a rollercoaster of hope of planning things out and saying ""this time I really will try"" and then I start feeling such detrimental pain it gets unbearable because I know I really can't. I don't know why I can't I'm just stupid and useless. There's things I like and enjoy but I never can enter a field like that because I wouldn't be able to handle the stress.
I mean I can't even do simple commissions for art and that's my only talent. It doesn't help that when I turned 17 I was barely starting to appreciate being in school and then I realized 
I'm about to be a legal adult, my parents are going to expect more from me, I spent middleschool and highschool being stressed out because I've just been suffering so much from depression and trauma, and now that I was starting to heal from that my brain won't have time to process it because it's time to grow up. Does that make sense?..
 God I'm so tired and sad. 2 days ago I was thinking about maybe trying to read more and focus more on science or stuff or maybe study some mortician stuff, but I can't. The cycle just happened again and now I feel miserable and hopeless because I'll probably never get out of this endless loop of misery. 
My life isn't terrible or anything it's just that, I can never process things properly, or do things properly. I've become so lazy and I can't function at all anymore. Now it's so hard. I don't even procrastinate anymore, I just don't even do anything at all.
I couldn't even go through getting a part time job for the meantime. I'm afraid of becoming a neet but maybe I'm just that miserable that I'll let myself become one till I die or something. I don't have anyone to talk to about this either because if I have a conversation it will make me feel worse or like they don't understand, and they fmight but it won't fix anything. Strangers and close friends still say the same thing and they can't do anything about it because this is just a me problem that I need to learn how to fix on my own"

1239,depression,I can't do or feel anything,"Hello guys,
I'm dealing with a problem, maybe it's not a big one, but I want to confess it to someone. I started realizing that I'm not passionate about anything and I do the daily activities just like a ""to do list"", here including: watching series, looking at videos on Youtube. I do them and I don't feel anything : no surprise, no fascination, no hatred. My friends talk around me about their passions, their dreams and I feel I have no direction and also I feel everything is pointless. Even the field I study in College is not so fascinating or surprising, it's just decent and I can learn that quantify of information.

I literally spend all my day wasting time in my bed, scrolling on Facebook, thinking : ""what if I would did the things better in the past?"", without energy and with some suicidal thoughts, to cut off completely the situation I'm going through.


Everytime I try to memorize something about history, politics, geography, actors, etc. , literally anything, I feel I force myself to remember that and it's such a hard thing.

This memorizing process affects me even when I'm on the street or in any situation : ""Have you noticed that sign or that store?"", ""Do you remember that that person  wore a red dress, right?"". No, I don't remember these details.

I'm just lost in this whole target wind : passions, dreams, getting a gf, future plans (I don't have any and I don't feel I can make any) and I feel like an empty vase without feelings.

Also I know I have no talent at anything and everything seems forced.

I have to mention it's not depression, because I took meds who worked both as anxiolitics and antidepressants and they didn't work in my case.

Any suggestions for my problem?"

1241,depression,Would taking medication for mental illness make you less able to cope with your condition after stopping your doses compared to before you had ever taken medication?,"Say for example John has crippling depression. John went 6 years without taking medication and fighting depression alone with no assistance. He has become used to the pain in a sense but it still ruins his life in all sorts of ways. Then, one day, John decides to seek help from a professional and begins taking antidepressants for a couple years. They make him cope better, but for whatever reason, John decides to stop taking his antidepressants (the reason does not matter). Would John be less able to cope with his depression now since he became used to having the aid of medication and now is suddenly alone and without help again? Ignoring specific life circumstances and simply focusing on the depression; would he be at an even higher risk of suicide compared to before since he isn't used to this level of pain anymore and it came back so quickly and suddenly? Or would he simply revert to how he was before the medication and can get by the same as back then?"
1242,depression,Plans...,"Usually I wouldn't be so upset over something so minor, but lately I've been very irritable. All week I was planning on going to a haunted house with my friend. We planned what we were going to do at the event, what date and time we were going to go, what we were going to wear, but the day right before she just backed out. For some reason that just broke me. Completely.
Instead of going somewhere fun today, I laid in bed."

Nothing ever changes no matter how much I try to improve or accentuate my few strengths.

I‚Äôm invisible and I long for death. All I fucking want is the validation that I was denied since my nuts dropped as a kid.

I‚Äôve always been invisible and guys I just can‚Äôt do it anymore.

I just want kids and a family, to be accepted.

It‚Äôs not an option for me though.

But god fucking forbid I send a bullet through my throat cuz then a handful of idiots who care about me would have their worlds ruined

And the worst part is even when i do try to talk to people i don‚Äôt take that opportunity to be friends cuz of every mental illness i have.

1248,depression,‚ÄúThings happen for a reason‚Äù,"Maybe not. 

What did I do to deserve this ? 

Give me a reason why living is so hard."
1249,depression,I sexually assaulted my younger cousin but at the same time did not.,"This all started when I was 12 years old, I used to always go to my uncle‚Äôs house like every week or so. He has three daughters one of them being 17, the other being 15 and the youngest being 9. 

I remember I used to love playing games with my cousins like tag and many other childish games. So sometimes I used to play these kinds of games with my younger cousin which is 9 right now but was 7 at the time. 

It was all fine and we used to have fun till one day, I felt being touched. Now I was very stupid as a child, I thought she did it on purpose but in reality she did it by accident. The problem was I was holding her arm when she did that so I‚Äôm scared that when she grows up she will think I forcefully pulled her arm and put it on my genital. 

This is not the main problem though, I remember right after I felt being touched I went and touched her in the same area I got touched, yes. Now at that time I did know what a vagina was, but I thought it was located somewhere in the butt because ever since I was growing up my mom used to tell me that girls pee from their butts.

I remember my younger cousin twerking a lot on my face without me knowing and it kind of feels weird but I‚Äôm not that bothered with it since she was a child and didn‚Äôt really understand it was wrong. I used to always tell her, ‚Äú stop twerking, you don‚Äôt know to do it.‚Äù Because I thought this would make her stop but I realized that the more I used to say it the more she would do it. So I stopped saying it and caring. 

When we used to play these games I also realized that I would always be behind her so it used to look like I was dry humping her or rubbing it on her. But again, when I used to do this I didn‚Äôt have a deep brain about sexual activity so I just kept on with it and thought it was normal.

A few months after this happened I remember playing a game which involves taking the phone from each other. She took my phone and ran around with it and then we she got tired she was standing near the bed bending over. When I saw that she was using my phone and spamming random passwords I rushed to take it from her immediately. I stood behind her and bent over to take the phone from her hand, and when I took it I quickly opened it and checked it. While I was checking it I noticed she was twerking on me, so I remember pushing her and I got angry and yelled at her. And by the way, this was after my mind developed sexually.

I don‚Äôt blame it on her, even If I was doing all this stuff while not being aware I take full responsibility for my stupidity and lack of knowledge even if I was only 12 years old. I realized that most children would exposed to porn before being 12 and I shocked and anxious because I know this could be used against me. When I was 12 I indeed did know what sex was but I never had a deep mind about it because i only saw a couple of sex scenes which only involved kissing in bed without showing nudity. I also used to watch kissing pranks before i was 12 but this doesnt really have an effect on what i did since its just kissing.

I also remembered grabbing her ass while she was twerking on my face as a joke, because some videos i used to watch on the internet involved this stuff and really thought of it as jokes. some examples of these videos involved jake paul and logan Paul. And as a kid I remember it was so easy to manipulate me, for example whenever I used to watch something I would end up doing the same actions  in the videos. 

I just turned 14 last week and for the past 2 months I've been feeling sad and afraid. I'm sick of it, I'm sick of faking my smiles with my friends and family. I'm very afraid of what will happen with my future, more importantly to my cousin's future because I know that she will one day realize this and think I'm a bad person because it looked like i was fully aware of what I was doing. I plan on apologizing to my cousin in the future, but I'm afraid that she won't believe me and I would later be portrait as a bad person. 

And to finish this story, I deeply apologize to every single person who are victims of sexual assault and rape. I just want to let all of you know that it's not your faults and you guys are kings and queens. So please keep your heads up. Goodbye and have a good day."

1251,depression,I got drunk last night and told my friend that I'm on antidepressants and feel suicidal,"And what seemed like a good idea at the time has left me feeling embarrassed and ashamed this morning. I'm hoping she doesn't remember or chooses to not mention it, because sober me wouldn't dream of talking about this. 

I don't know why it makes me feel so uncomfortable but it does. I wouldn't be ashamed to let her know that I'm on medication for asthma, say, so why does this feel so embarrassing?"
1252,depression,Don't know what to do anymore,"Hate who I have become. 4 am and I can't sleep cause I blew a fuck ton of money gambling like a degenerate.

1253,depression,"I don't know if its depression or not, but i sleep way too much","I'm a 25 years old male and as long as i can remember i had this problem.
I sleep about 10 hours a day and sometimes 12 hours, not because i feel sleepy but because sleeping is much more enjoyable then anything i can do when im awake.
I dont have any energy to do anything in my day.

Between work and my excessive sleeping the few hours left in my day i spend it on social media and netflix.
Again i had this problem since my early teens years."
1254,depression,why do I feel like this,"I know so many people with divorced parents, just big family problems in general. I have good grades, good parents,friends gave been, well...meh. But something is not right. (TW:SH discussion)
Right now I feel like everything should be fine. But something says otherwise. 
In the first quarantine, shit hit the fan. My dad was working abroad so my mom was alone with my sisters. It was awful, if she wasn't in the mood for even eating, no one would, I'd have to make dinner for my sisters out of scraps. If she felt bad, everyone would. During that period, my sh got worse, Id use it as a reward for finishing assignments and so on. It was hard on everyone, she acted like it was only for her, when I would be the one to clean up her mess. In a sense she was right, but only to a small extent.
In April (2020) she noticed my cuts. She looked me in the eyes and told me she would check on me everyday to make sure I wouldn't do it anymore (never admitted it, I just told her a lame excuse but there was no chance of hiding at that point). She never did. I realized she doesn't care, neither does my dad. If grades are good and we are respectful, shit is great.
It has been a long time since then, my parents act like everything is perfect. I have been clean for seven months but it'll reset soon. I don't know why. I feel like this period of time is what affects me the most but idfk why and it's frustrating. Almost as if I want to be sad."
1255,depression,suffering for the possibility of a better future,"I‚Äôve felt like dogshit for years. I go to a very conservative school in a pretty conservative town and ever since I came out as transgender my mental health has only gotten worse. I am constantly being misgendered, people harass me by calling me slurs or being generally transphobic and stuff like that has been only getting worse. At this point I‚Äôm worried it will keep escalating - in my county half of all reported hate crimes came from my town, the majority of which were on the basis of being LGBT, and we dont know the real number cause most lgbtq ppl in my town are scared of the cops. I don‚Äôt even really know why I‚Äôm attending school or working so hard on my assignments. I tell myself I‚Äôm going to school because I want to have a job I love and that I go through all this pain everyday because I want to know things will get better, but what will I do if it doesn‚Äôt get better? what if I hate life later just as much as I hate it now? Even if I did enjoy life later, would all the pain I‚Äôm in now even have been really worth it? Even if I did enjoy life later, I will still be broken. I don‚Äôt even have any close friends at the school, only one person I talk to online. I am in therapy, and my therapist is good but my parents have forced me to see him biweekly instead of every week (not because we have to we can afford to see him every week). I‚Äôm extraordinarily fortunate I can see him at all, but it would be a lie to say that its isn‚Äôt effecting me a lot. I tried to take his advice and talk to my online friend about what I‚Äôm going through, but even if I get as far as mentioning it to him, I never truly talk about whats going on since I try to turn all of the bad experiences I have into a joke. All fo this pain has no meaning. This pain will probably never be worth it in the end, but I can‚Äôt kill myself do to my younger siblings so I may just be like this for a very long time.

1258,depression,I'm tired of this. (idk where to post),"

I'm sick and tired of arguing with my mum constantly, tired of cutting, tired of chucking up my food, and I'm nackered. Fucking constantly I'm nackered. Having ADHD and being a teen is no help, either.

I want to attempt again because idk. I don't want to do all this shit anymore. 

My mum thinks im faking it? telling her I want to die//will kill myself for fun or something? I don't know. 

If your kid has never taken off his hoodie in 3 YEARS, constantly says they want to die, if you find bloody plasters dotted around, you're seriously not going to care? That doesn't say anything? 
But she yells at me when I dont eat, and once I refused food and she started yelling at me.

Tbh i really don't care if she gives a shit. I just want some fucking help. But hey, you can't get any help!! Let alone make anyone believe that my problems are real. Because when it does come to professionals, like my youth worker, I CANT TELL HIM ANYTHING! Because then he has to tell my mum. She clearly doesn't care. But? idk. I can't speak to professionals, i don't know what to say.

Anyway you can't get help! 


i don't know what to do anymore because i'm so tired of everything. I don't *want to die* it just want all of this shit to stop!

I am nihilistic. I don't think anything matters and I have a very depressing outlook on life.

It's rare, but there are people I share with the twisted and dark depths of my mind with, and I do love them and they love me. Most of the time I find a common ground and that my thoughts are shared among many more people than I thought. 

But... I think it's even more common that what's really going on in your head is shunned by society and norms.

Am I disturbed or do most people think this way? I think most people do, but I find this topic to be hard to talk about."

1285,depression,Partner is depressed and I can't fix it,"I know I am not supposed to fix her but it hurts so much to see her in her own misery.

On the weekends her emptiness shows the most. She wants to find something worth the time but instead finds nothing to do. She has little projects she wants to do but when the moment comes she does not want to do it anymore. If that makes any sense, sorry I am not a native speaker.

Like, we love to watch birds and she got a nice little birdhouse for our balcony and she has to apply a protection layer for the wood to it and put it out there. She looks every week at it and says this weekend I am gonna do it but then she can't get to the point of starting.

I know I could help her and do stuff for her but the problem is she wants to have her own energy to do this.

I did this mistake so many times, to try to do these things for her and she is usually happy with the outcome when things got done but the core problem of her not knowing what she wants to do and bringing the energy up to do if she finds it, is still there.

These pandemic times are not doing her a favour as well.

We moved shortly before the pandemic started to a new town and making friends is really hard when you are a couple in your late 20s, at least for us. 

Right now we planned to go to Ikea with a friend that comes from our old town but she only lies on the couch and turns around when I enter the room. I hope she finds the motivation to get up and come with us.

She deserves so much better like all of you in this sub. She has bright green eyes and lovely brown hair. I admire her and love her in a way I can't describe with words. But not only that, she is my best friend and sometimes we both get to our limits and I feel like breaking down and I just can and she holds me when I cry and let it all out. 

This is so crazy, she gives me so much strengths and I am glad if I can just give her a fraction of it back. 

I just had to write it down once, thank you if you read all this personal shit about my life lol"

I don‚Äôt ever really do that but I got nothing else so why not? This lost its direction, more of a ramble now. I took a few edibles (rare for me) and dam I got so paranoid.

1287,depression,I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm just sharing pls be nice,"I was never medically diagnosed with depression therefor I don‚Äôt claim that I have illness but since I was 13 tried to kill myself twice, luckily I survived. 

A little background about me: 
When I was born my existence was already denied by my fathers side whole family for a factor that I cannot control. I was born with the religion of Christianity and my fathers family didn‚Äôt like my mother thus growing the hate on me aswell. 
Growing up Being denied to family gatherings that my half sister (father side) can attend to was a regular for me. I would also always get bullied by my half sister (father side) and my brother (mother side) on a regular, the home bullying was regular for me I would get my ass kicked and suffer regular black eyes and bloated face and bloody nose from my brother, and he would always tell me that their life got worse when I was born. 
In school aswell I didn‚Äôt make any friends for the fear that my classmates would hurt me to. All of my elementary years I would also get bullied thrown into a corner for I did not speak often. Beatings insults are a daily occurrence, it also didn‚Äôt help that my father became a drunkard and would fight my mother almost every night and would become progressively abusive.
Reaching the age 13 I would become scared to trust I would use art and video games to escape, but it eventually problems caught up. For my tiny heart back then I cannot handle the stress thus resulting into my first attempt, I would try to hang myself but luckily failed due to I didn‚Äôt know how to set the noose up without being seen by others as I was a kid and didn‚Äôt know much.

Before my second attempt I would find one of my first best friends, a dog abandoned by a broken family. I would talk to him on a regular about my struggles and would receive kisses from him he elevated my and made me happy in the darkest days of my life, but sadly he parted away due to an illness that was not diagnosed till it was too late. The event of losing him took me back to the same old buried in sadness I felt before I met him but this time it was more painful. 2 months of losing him and being on the same position after having him I would try to hang my self again but luckily failed due to my mother seeing the noose set up and removing it. My mother gave me a hours heart felt conversation but out of that conversation that only dialogue that made sense to me was ‚Äúyour bestfriend(my dog) wouldn‚Äôt want to see you hurt yourself like this.‚Äù I broke down, I cried so much that I passed out and woke up the next morning.

After all of that I‚Äôm here now 19 years of age got 2 dogs that help me get through things, pursuing architecture but still have the same problems.

I would also always get bullied by my half sister (father side) and my brother (mother side) on a regular, the home bullying was regular for me I would get my ass kicked and suffer regular black eyes and bloated face and bloody nose from my brother, and he would always tell me that their life got worse when I was born. 

In school aswell I didn‚Äôt make any friends for the fear that my classmates would hurt me to. All of my elementary years I would also get bullied thrown into a corner for I did not speak often. Beatings insults are a daily occurrence, it also didn‚Äôt help that my father became a drunkard and would fight my mother almost every night and would become progressively abusive.

Reaching the age 13 I would become scared to trust I would use art and video games to escape, but it eventually problems caught up. For my tiny heart back then I cannot handle the stress thus resulting into my first attempt, I would try to hang myself but luckily failed due to I didn‚Äôt know how to set the noose up without being seen by others as I was a kid and didn‚Äôt know much.

Before my second attempt I would find one of my first best friends, a dog abandoned by a broken family. I would talk to him on a regular about my struggles and would receive kisses from him he elevated my and made me happy in the darkest days of my life, but sadly he parted away due to an illness that was not diagnosed till it was too late. The event of losing him took me back to the same old buried in sadness I felt before I met him but this time it was more painful. 2 months of losing him and being on the same position after having him I would try to hang my self again but luckily failed due to my mother seeing the noose set up and removing it. My mother gave me a hours heart felt conversation but out of that conversation that only dialogue that made sense to me was ‚Äúyour bestfriend(my dog) wouldn‚Äôt want to see you hurt yourself like this.‚Äù I broke down, I cried so much that I passed out and woke up the next morning.

After all of that I‚Äôm here now 19 years of age got 2 dogs that help me get through things, pursuing architecture but still have the same problems and a growing hatred about myself.

Do you guys have a similar experience? Do you mind sharing on of your own as this is my first time sharing something like this."
1289,depression,Hit a new low,"4.5 years of depression. Finally cut myself for the first time today. It‚Äôs crazy how life turns out, I used to think slitters and self harmers were stupid cause I didn‚Äôt understand their mentality, but here I am today. Life always goes the same, all day every day. Have school all 7 days of the week due to some prep courses I‚Äôm enrolled in, yet I still feel behind in life. I just want a break.


As for how it felt, it felt like being pressed by a cup of hot water. Gave 50-60 slashes before blood finally showed up and I penetrated my skin. The first one was painful, but the rest hurt less and less. 

As for why I did this, I struggle showing emotions outwardly, I usually feel them inside intensely, for the first time it felt like I released them outside, vented to the world, and got validation I was actually depressed and need help and that it wasn‚Äôt my mind tricking me into thinking I was depressed. That‚Äôs probably why this isn‚Äôt going to be the last time I do this."

Just a few moments ago, my mom asked why I‚Äôve been wearing long sleeves. She knows I‚Äôve been harming since 5th grade. She made me show her my arms. She got mad and asked why I do this. I said stress. Because it is stress and punishment to myself. My left arm was horrible.

And she‚Äôll tell my dad and last time that happened he screamed and cried at me and told me he wish I would d!e‚Ä¶so‚Ä¶

1293,depression,Fight or Fight?,"I think this is the correct term for how I handle certain situations but I'm unsure. Hoping someone can give me some insight.

An example of this would be say I'm put in a stressful situation at work that sends me into an almost complete breakdown. 

A stressful situation to me could be being called into the managers office for something I did wrong or some sort of issue that has happened. I get so overwhelmed and upset that I will simply walk out and leave. By doing this, in my mind, I don't have to deal with the situation anymore and can avoid the anxiety and stress I was overcome with during that particular situation.

For the brief moment of walking out, as in just getting in the car without telling anyone and going home, I feel somewhat relaxed knowing I am away from the situation and do not have to face it. Of course then the panic sets in a few hours later of what did I just do. When that begins to happen I have allowed myself to slightly calm down before the panic of do I still have a job sets in.

I tend to do this in all stressful situations. I simply leave or walk away because I cannot handle what is going on. It's not until later that I realize the consequences my actions may have caused. Would this be considered a fight or flight reaction?"

I was bullied throughout my entire elementary years. Had an awkward relationship with my dad when I became a teenager (I‚Äôm the youngest and my dads favorite) and he yelled at me a lot.

As someone who struggles with depression and anxiety, I know how difficult everyday life can become. Mental health is still misunderstood, and finding help can be difficult and expensive. I'm passionate about mental health and want to try to help as many people as possible. Mental health improvement needs a revolutionary idea to help make it more accessible and convenient. 

    What are some things you wish you could have or wish were available to you to help you with your mental health? Better access to therapy?  Help with medication?  Diet and exercise? An app?   I'm trying to brainstorm some ideas. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

1305,depression,high school makes me just want to runaway,"I am currently a freshman in high school I just want to want to runaway.

School is usually something I can just glide through and I enjoy for the most part. I tend to do the assignments I enjoy and skip the things I find menial. I am told that I am smart kid, I don't get bullied, and I get acceptable grades. I wake up everyday to the same routine. I feel like I'm a inanimate robot just going through the motions. I honestly just don't no what to do. Everyday is miserable I put up with school until I get home then I just play games to take my mind off of everything. Everything I do is just enough to get me to the next day. I feel like I'm running in place, like I could have run marathon but I am just stuck. I don't want to go college for the life I want. Its as if someone just stole 4 years out of my life before I was even born, that feeling is so draining to me. I can't keep skipping school (I miss 2 days every week). I tried running away over the summer, I got a couple miles but I knew I couldn't go without money for long so I just called my parents to not drag it out. The only reason I haven't ran away again is because I don't want to put my family through that again just to come back. I'm aware that running away won't exactly solve any problems but it would at least be something new. 

I get treated for bi-polar depression which I've started recently and also see I therapist. Every solution people in my support system just feels like enough so I don't kill myself or runaway again. I can't keep doing this, I won't kill myself but I need a solution whether its dropping out or just running away. Its enticing, the idea of running away with a couple grand and setting up a simple life thousands of miles from here making just enough to support myself."

My family I avoid because of their toxic behavior and just so many stories of why I avoid them mostly let alone be able to go to any of them. 

About 5 months ago me,my son's mother and our son finally saved up and I found a good enough job to move out of my parents house in which we were living in ...about an hour away from anyone into a house with them,her sister and her mother. Which neither of them 3 I can go to and also me and her aren't together anymore so I have to pick up again and do it all over. I work 7 days a week at miserable fumigation job that it feels it takes over my life mentality and physically so until I find a job in which is as good or better pay I'm stuck and I'm to mentality tired to even try to look. Me and her do not get along of what's so ever and its been hard on us yes but especially on me because she has her family and more friends to go to in which I do not and she doesn't care to really talk about my issues nor try to understand or care when she even wants too. I can try and find friends but those times I wanna spend with my son because he's truly my little buddy and I'm a proud father and I love him so much also plus I have no time to even do that.. let alone fully enjoy some of my hobbies. (I work nights) 

I feel stuck... I've had problems with substances to coup with this situation and with my sever depression in which I get stuck in such a dark place that at some point my own son doesn't switch the thoughts of ending it so I have to think of him crying next to my casket to bring me back sort of. Also I've been starting to remember some terrible things that I blocked out from my childhood also when I'm in this dark haze,putting things together and remembering the sever mental,physical and...sexual abuse and just the childhood I wouldn't wish on no one.. I'm surprised I'm even still here and I'm proud of my strength.

I've been recently trying to stay sober after months of drinking every night,smoking every night and there was a moment I was doing E pills every night also about 2 months straight.. so there was times I didn't  sleep or ate for 3 or 2 days straight. Tonight I lost it at work because it's a miserable atmosphere and the one guy started yelling and I just flipped out and now I'm laying here..straing at the wall and crying just wishing things would get better. 

I just... don't know what to do anymore. I could never end it and do that to my son and I wanna watch him grow up and be there... but my life feels like it falls apart to quick enough for me to pick up the pieces and the chaos in my head I just want it to stop.

So at 19 I tried to go to college and the same thing happened I dropped out of school a few months in do to the issues. At that point I started struggling with suicidal thoughts and extreme depression everyday. Still to this day. Also I looked a lot older due to this wrinkles on my face I would be a really good looking guy but I‚Äôve gotten so old looking in just the past five years. I really just feel like a freak and I feel like I‚Äôve lost everything like I need to have a funeral for the old me the me I really am and want to be but it doesn‚Äôt seem possible.

I get these spells of sadness and I used to be able to distract myself from them pretty easily just by hanging out with friends or family but that's working less and less as time goes by. I even find myself avoiding people just because I don't have enough energy to pretend to be fine. I used to love having friends over and would even be devastated when they couldn't come over but now I don't really care. Now I spend most of my days sleeping or watching yt videos but not really paying attention to it because none of them interest me anymore. I'll just be staring into space wondering why I feel like this and I'm scared it's only going to get worse.
1326,depression,Lonely,At the moment I just feel so lonely. I've lost so many friends lately and it seems as if im destined to be lonely. Its obvious god saying I don't need/deserve friends and will only help people get them. Yesterday my plans got cancelled with no warning and when I offered a way it could work they straight up refused. Im so tired of this. So if you'll excuse me ill just be alone like always.
1327,depression,:(,I constantly disrespect myself for others. I constantly take the hardest route. I constantly hurt others when I don't mean to. I constantly feel intense emotions that guide me. I constantly think people hate me.
1328,depression,Relapse has just been so fun- just fantastic. I hate this,"3 Years ago I was at my lowest and it‚Äôs all coming back, dunno why. It‚Äôs just been looming over me the past six months or so. Maybe I‚Äôm just realizing I‚Äôm a shitty person. Or quarantine or the stress of school. Maybe all of the above. I self harmed again for the first time in a while. Didn‚Äôt even regret breaking my streak. Everyday is the same. So mundane with an empty feeling inside of me. I can‚Äôt even cry. I‚Äôm so tired all the time. I really can‚Äôt see myself living super long into the future. I feel like I‚Äôm not walking in life, just being dragged along. I‚Äôm trying so hard to seem like I‚Äôm okay, but I‚Äôm not and I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep this up. Nothing I ever do is good enough for anything. I barely deserve air to breathe. I wanna try to push my friends to new friends, make em forget about me. I don‚Äôt deserve them anyways. Family would be better off without me too. I just- I don‚Äôt know."
1329,depression,can someone really be as pathetic and dumb as i was too think otherwise,"Im so devastated in many ways.  
I don‚Äôt remember a time where ive been made to feel absolutely irrelevant despite how pivotal we were in each other‚Äôs lives.    Many devastating events during our  relationship past and present have come to light and in certian situations almost ended my life.. it was none other than her‚Ä¶. Deep down i can say i knew all along‚Ä¶ 

Soooo this anger i have‚Ä¶ this hatred this great disgust for anyone who can look you in the eye, write countless letters and apologies‚Ä¶ how is it that one can toy with a significant other, string em on  and when it mattered the most. ‚Ä¶. Left you with nothing wirh no remose‚Ä¶.  How was i that blind‚Ä¶. And too add‚Ä¶ in the course 36 months‚Ä¶. It happened 3 more times‚Ä¶."
1330,depression,not sure how much longer I can take it,"My entire life feels like a big fucking joke. Not only was I cursed with a broken fucking brain but also shitty circumstances. I try not to talk abt my feelings to most ppl because I feel bad pitying myself when I know others have it worse. But I legitimately cannot fucking take it anymore. I have no motivation to go to college, I am disgustingly fucking ugly, Im living in a literal fucking crackhouse with my piece of shit father because my mom left after he cheated on her (for the 5th time). This month I went nearly two weeks without running water, one day without electricity, and I still have no gas (so no hot water). My dad basically quit his job and is now barely working and making half as much as he was a year ago. Our house is in the middle of being foreclosed and I dont know if I will have time to save money to move out on my own before we are kicked out. Ive never felt so fucking alone. Its impossible to date when you're an antisocial ugly loser that lives in the house that I do. Ive never really had a real relationship. I probably never will. I have maybe one real friend, and sometimes I feel like even they dont really care for me. I dont know what it feels like to be loved. To be happy. Everyday tasks are so fucking hard for me, even getting out of bed sometimes makes me feel like id rather be dead. I think abt suicide every day, but im a bitch and im scared to die. I want to believe in something, anything but its so hard when everything in my life has gone so wrong. I remember when I had dreamt of my future, my career, my life and I felt hope. I dont know what happened. I guess at this point ive just accepted that im going to die a fucking virgin loser failure. I want it to be over."
1331,depression,I just don‚Äôt feel like living I guess,"Nothings specifically wrong and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd consider myself as dealing with a bad bit of depression either. I honestly don‚Äôt know. I just don‚Äôt feel like living. I just don‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs a point to it, or to anything really. Doing something ‚Äúfun‚Äù has the same effect as staring at the wall for hours. I‚Äôm sure it will pass but It just kinda sucks right now."
1332,depression,"One by one, all my dreams are dead","Just that.

If I didn't already have depression, I'd have gotten it by now. 

I'm literally just... hanging on. God I don't know why I'm here."
1333,depression,Depressed and obsessed,"I had no reason or will to live. No purpose until I met a small group of online friends. We chatted and within a month, we became really good friends...but as we became closer they were able to spot my...flaws. One of which is that I get really attached to ppl I meet. (Anyone like me?) I'm not sure if it's because I'm traumatized by what happened to me in the past. (The bullying. The isolation. The lack of friends). It drove me into depression for several years and almost suicidal. I (think?) I'm getting better? But I'm not sure. 

Now when I meet new friends online....I get really attached...especially if they are relatable. Im...desperate. The fear of losing them plagued my mind. In fact I treated them almost like my siblings...They were....accepting of me and my flaws. And I felt....loved. 

Now the issue comes in. They're like really young(minors) and I'm 21.  So whenever I express my ""love"" in some public servers... some found it creepy... (Saying hearing their voices give me hope, and I wish to make them happy). I genuinely meant that. I was...in a dark place...their voices gave me strength to carry on. And I always tried to appease them..buy them gifts and such. Like an older sibling would :] 

I'm not like that. I ain't....one of those creeps/pedos. Ugh.  I just....had no purpose in my life. Felt no reason to live...until I met them. I want to take care of them...like how an older sibling does. I never had siblings...I just hate it that its considered wrong and creepy to love your online friends. Like....the age shouldn't matter. But it does. And one should be very careful about the way they speak....sigh."
1334,depression,nostalgia is going to make me fail school (please read this),"it‚Äôs an exaggeration but i‚Äôm in first year of college and have a super hard exam at 7:20 am(it‚Äôs currently) 12:10 am and i haven‚Äôt studied a bit.
i‚Äôve spend all day thinking of my best friend in elementary and how we saw each other grow, find hobbies, cry, laugh, get angry, everything. 
We went to a small elementary school so even though we did get other friends, we never split apart, we were the main thing.
We went to the same middle school (which had waaaaaaaaaaay more people than my other school) and we found new friends and started to naturally separate from each other.
I‚Äôm on college now and he lives like 6 states away."
1335,depression,I never been treated so unfairly throughout my life before,"This will be a long story, my apologies! And yes, SIMP alert, just to put it out here.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok it is all started with this girl who is my crush, turns out she's a manager of her company and she's looking for someone to hire. So I step in and wanted to do a marketing role which she agreed to. We helped each other and she even said she was thankful that I was there helping her because we're already short of manpower on an overloaded task set by our boss (which is her mother). Fast forward, one of the employee quit because he can't take it anymore because our boss being an asshole towards him. So since we're running low on manpower, i volunteer to take that ex-colleague role which is retail/bakery/storekeeper for the time being while my manager plans to hire someone else. But ... she didn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

Months pass by, and I'm having trouble doing multiple tasks here in this job. Not only I'm doing task that is way out of my jobscope, but I'm also having to do Overtime DAILY with only one-off day and no pay increase. Ok, not asking for a pay increase is my fault to be honest because I volunteer to stay back only because my manager stays back. Since no one is there to help her, I have to stay back so I don't mind doing it without any overtime pay. However, she seems to pick on me alot. Scold me whenever I couldn't get the job done that was assigned by her but the problem is, THERE ARE SO MUCH THINGS TO DO. And things not even on my jobscope.

&amp;#x200B;

I brought this up to her and she said she ""understand"" so she hired another person but that person is doing the role that I WAS INITIALLY signed up for. Instead of hiring retail/bakery/storekeeper, she hired a marketer which is what I was supposed to do. I was abit upset with this and I brought up this issue again and she said ""she understand"". I still like her very much so my anger towards her kind of depleted. But... she didn't actually do anything, as a matter in fact, she and her boss keeps scolding me of the things I did by a small mistake or not even my doing, yes I'm getting blamed for stuff that is NOT my doing. But then again, it is because of her I stayed. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been like this for 8 long months, And I can't handle it anymore because of all the unfairness that i've been getting. That one final scold from boss which is by far the most ridiculous thing I ever experienced, I quit and my manager kinda cried. But I did promise her that I will try to help her behind the scenes, in regards of marketing (and this will also prove to her that I  can help her do this role which I promised to). Things go smooth actually, but then she suddenly just changed the password of the company which I kinda needed to continue her work. She didn't even notify me, so i texted her and she just drop the ball on me saying I'm no longer working in the company because boss don't want me to work with her behind the scenes. She could have told me earlier instead of me wasting my time?. But that's not the suckiest part...

&amp;#x200B;

This is the suckiest part that makes me WANT TO KILL MYSELF, One of our colleague got forced to do a task outside of his jobscope and just for one day, he complains. AND MY MANAGER ACKNOWLEDGED IT AND STARTS TO PANIC. She apologize to him and said she learnt her lesson, as a matter in fact, she even plan to increase his pay. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? all these time of me working my ass off for 8 months doing multiple task that isn't my jobscope, being in Overtime DAILY with only one off day and this is what i get? no payment increase, no nothing?? And now I have no job, I was planning to be graphic designer which I'm working on my portfolio very hard for it, and now I have to rush finding a job, my plans to be a graphic designer have to put on halt and the worst of it all, I am still livid about all of this situation. She just living her life as per normal treating her colleagues with fairness while she shit on me. And I want to bring this up to her as my one final moment.. should I do it? I can't live with myself how I got screwed over and now I feel helpless. And I like her, she even said she used to like me. This whole thing sucks, I am so angry about the situation but I'm not fully angry with her. What is wrong with me? what should i do?"
1336,depression,New friends + depression,"Just don‚Äôt mix‚Ä¶ hate trying to explain to people that I will eventually become a hermit and not respond to any messages. Wish I could take a break from having responsibilities. I‚Äôm so tired. No advice needed, just venting."
1337,depression,I‚Äôve never felt this way before and I need someone to tell me what I can do this is the first time I‚Äôve ever felt this immense sadness and I think it‚Äôs here to stay,I recently was told very shocking news that I can‚Äôt or never will get the chance to get over ( I will not say because it‚Äôs still not real to me writing it out makes this whole situation real so I‚Äôm sorry). My uncle and I are the only ones who know and he told me not to tell anyone but it‚Äôs eating me inside I need someone to talk to but I don‚Äôt have anyone to turn to. I‚Äôve cried so much that my eyes are hurting. All I have been thinking about is why. So many thoughts are running through my brain. I want to be thankful for my girlfriend my family my situation up until this point but it‚Äôs so hard right now. Please help me I need something anything to help me feel better. I can‚Äôt get my crying to stop even now Im still crying like I just started hours ago. I know that I‚Äôve been a terrible person and maybe what im going through is justice or karma but I really need someone to tell me something to make this all make sense.
1338,depression,I am stuck in a loop,"Since young I have been bullied.  How I am fat and indian  and it apparently was a problem to others. Everyday I get bullied,  for how I look. My mom used to do my hair with coconut oil, which was smelly for them. The food I brought were smelly for them. I looked ugly to them, like a alien. 

Throughout my 7-18 years of age I have been bullied everyday. They would throw sugar on me, steal my stuff, one time a girl kept smacking me on my head with a toy knife right in front of the teacher and I couldn't do anything. I just sat there and counted how many time she smacked me. 

After I turned 18 I needed to take a diploma of my liking by this point I was sad, did not know what to do, where to go, no dreams, no friends. From the day my school ended I just kept sleeping everyday. Usually teens will be hanging out with friends and working. But I was not able to do that. 

Eventually Got into a diploma that I did not like but still went ahead cause I finally escaped hell. Towards the start of the diploma I started feeling optimistic and motivated. It was like suddenly I was feeling all better. I decided to start afresh and I was actually able to do it. Well for the 3 years of diploma I aced everything, I had friends,  made study groups joined 4 different extra curriculums. I was able to concentrate and focus. I lost a ton of weight. I was in some Leadership positions. 


After I graduated I became depressed. I felt  the friends I has were not real. My diploma was in waste, I was a failure in every thing I do. I deleted all pics of me because I hated the way i looked. Stayed in bed all day and  cried. Did not go for any gathering or meetups. So my friends just stopped asking after a certain point. 


At this point I am completely alone, depressed, lonely and I did not know what to do next. work? or degree? I felt like I was wasting time. I didn't want stay like this. Forced myself to apply for all universities and potential  internships. I got both internship and acceptance but I was not jumping for joy. I knew I was depressed. I thought if I just jumped in all will work out fine. Once I am done I will be happy. 

To keep myself  busy I took both worked and did part time degree. I was wrong, I thought I would be happy but I became  more depressed, lonely and stressed. Numb to my feelings, I started to eat more. By my 2nd year in uni I was diagnosed  with diabetes. Fell into the spiral, did not have focus or motivation. Cried every night to sleep tries to harm myself by cutting my hand and hit myself several  times in the head to stop everything. Several times I wanted to die. I wanted to kill my self. 

None of which no one else knows because I hid everything from my family and colleagues. Because I was stubborn to not tell  anyone. Working on assignments till early morning but I won't  be able to sleep and I finally get to bed. Started to worry about everything and developed anxiety. I worried about everything. My work, my assignments, my face, my looks, my future, what will happen  if I die now, I was burned out from everything. I kept bottling up. Watched a lot of kdramas and bought a lot of things to cope. But nothing made me feel good. The company  thought I did well and gave me a permanent position. I did not get happiness  from this. This is where the pandemic hit there world. I started working from home. My concentration  was not there I felll back sometimes. Couldn't  understand lectures. 

When I finally finished my last exam for uni. I felt my body go numb, stayed in bed for 1 week. I took leave and just stayed in bed. After which I started to force my self out of bed and just wander around. By this time the restrictions  were lifted. I went to the mall alone, to the movies alone, walked. Just me and my head phones . I eat a lot during this time too. I hated how fat I looked. By the time I turned 23 I was 100 kg. 

 I had to loose weight because when marriages are arranged they potential  grooms hate fat women like me. Also due to my deteorating health. I kept getting  pain all over my body. 2021 I started my weight loss journey. Everything  became harder. Pulling my self out of bed going for a walk, gym. Till now I am trying. But I keep going in this loop where I will be doing well and there would be a rejection and I lose the motivation  to keep going. 

There was a time where I did not have food for 2-3 days. Other days I will lie and go out and eat everything. I wanted to be away from my home as far as possible for as long as possible because my home has now turned to hell. Everyday my mom and dad would scold me for sitting around. Everyday my mom and dad would point out my parts of my body to say they are fat. My stomach, leg, hands, arms, face, everything. Saying things like ""I know why you dun have friends, because who would be friends with if you are this fat?"", ""everyone is running away from you because you look like that"", "" who would want a elephant for a bride"", ""if you are fat now you will never be able to loose weight"" 


All these and several rejections and caused me to go in a loop. I would find some way to pick my self up and work on it. I will be trying my best to move forward. Than I break down when  I hear any comments as written above. Than I have to pick myself again little by little and try again. This has been happening to me since it started.  This is exhausting.

Before I decide to loose weight,  I did not let my depression affect my work or my family. Even though they hurt me, I didn't  speak of it much. But at the start of 2021 till now, I have had some panic attacks, I burst into tears and anger at small unessasary things. My work is also affected, I have not been happy and productive working also, It feels numb. Like I Do not want to do anything anymore. Waking up and brushing my teeth has not been a problem before. But now it takes me the whole morning. Going to the toilet takes time for me also . I keep sitting in my chair worrying  about everything, thinking blank till I feel pain then I realize. I has become worse. 

I see so many people working, being happy  I want to be happy but I am stuck I this loop. Unable move I am exhausted and tired. I have worked hard now I M 85 kg but I aim to be 70 by Dec. I have stuck here for a month now. No interest in anything. 


 This is my 1st time any one knows and I am telling the strangers on the internet."

1340,depression,I hate myself &amp; I‚Äôm super s*****al,"I am mad at society and I have so many reasons to be, but right now it‚Äôs because I feel like I can‚Äôt be good at things. I have this recurring thought that when my depression finally wins, I will make an impact on people that‚Äôs not my immediate family. But I really do think it‚Äôs nothing short of a fantasy. When the word comes that I‚Äôm not here anymore, those that aren‚Äôt related to me will have a short period of surprise and a select few may even feel down for a day or so, but then I will fade from their minds forevermore. And it‚Äôs very painful to know that I‚Äôve made such a small impact on people that I cared about, regardless of my many efforts. Like I‚Äôve said before, I‚Äôm so tired of meaning so little to so many."
1341,depression,"Well, how do you win against yourself ?","Ok so to set the scene, I‚Äôve just entered college but it hasn‚Äôt been much all the fun and cool stuff you get told in high school. So I lost most of my friends but struggle to find my place in my studies this year.
I don‚Äôt know how to bring this up but basically I‚Äôve been feeling completely empty lately like I have never been and I‚Äôm just 18. Like people keep saying go out speak to people make friends, laugh, but I don‚Äôt why but I can‚Äôt. I feel like people around me don‚Äôt understand me or just don‚Äôt have the same (idk if it‚Äôs the right term but) ""maturity"". So I end up staying alone with my thoughts wich has been a really bad thing these days, overthinking and the lack of sleep due to these thoughts really doesn‚Äôt help feeling better. So yeah I was wondering if you guys had any ideas about how to get out of this situation because overthinking and having the feeling of being completely empty and lonely really starts to be hard, it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore and as if I was losing myself.. So yeah any help or advice on what to do is welcome

ps: english isn‚Äôt my mother language so sorry if they are any mistakes"
1342,depression,I fucked up,"Hey, I fucked up for weeks, can‚Äôt get myself focused, couldn‚Äôt do anything every day. I have no motivation, But feel I need to do something about it all the time.

1343,depression,school,"Hi everyone! I hope you all had a lovely day. Anywho, I‚Äôm curious if anyone has any tips for climbing out of a depression-induced homework-hole. Not to say I‚Äôm particularly drowning in overdue assignments, I just seem to have a hard time staying on task these days, and find myself quickly overwhelmed. I chose to continue my studies online, and it honestly hasn‚Äôt been the easiest (though I 100% prefer it to going back in-person).My energy for it has depleted, and often leaves me feeling drained, and like the work is never done. I‚Äôm sure others have felt this way, and am wondering if anyone had any input on the matter/what has worked for you. Anything helps, and all appreciated. Thank you."

I'm finally gonna start doing something productive after 7 months. I just don't know where to start for drawing, what to attempt to draw even. But I'll just have to find a way I guess. I think this is finally going to be the first real step out of my depressive state. I'm finally ready to get better, to stop being a complete failure in life. All I need to do is to start. I might need some tips on improving more though."
1346,depression,"Depression, alcohol, and girls","Yesterday I went to a college party but before that, I had a little bit more than half a bottle of whiskey at a friend's place.
I just wanted to be numb and not have any bad feelings so I could go and talk to girls with ease.
I got drunk and 5 minutes after I went to the party the security guard kicked me out.
My friend called my sister to come and pick me up to take me home.
I went home I sat down and I threw up twice which caused my dad to wake up.
I feel like a fucking disgrace, having my sister and my dad take care of me, and missing the party. And even worse, when I woke up the next day I opened the phone and saw a message from my friend: ""I kissed a girl from poland"" which made me feel a lot worse for some reason.

What I want you to get out of this story is to never try to drink to take away your bad feelings, go to a doctor instead. Also, what separates real men from boys is being able to pick up girls without drinking alcohol."

1348,depression,I don‚Äôt feel like crying anymore,"I used to cry quite often, like couple of times a week but for the last maybe 6 months i just suddenly stopped.

Is this normal?"
1349,depression,Things won‚Äôt ever get easier,"This sadness is always gonna be creeping up on me. Even if I have a good week, there‚Äôs always the expectation of everything crashing and burning onto me. Like a raining cloud over my head. I‚Äôm just tired of feeling nothing and everything all the time. How do I even describe it?

Nobody understands around me. Who do I even talk to? No amount of therapy has helped me. It‚Äôs been over 10 years. I‚Äôm too young to be getting aged by this. 

This depression not only burdens me, but I know it burdens the people around me. The best I can do is try to escape it. Maybe I‚Äôll play guitar today, or bake something to keep my mind off of my own thoughts. Nobody understands me in my life and I‚Äôm that sense, I am alone. I feel so defective all the time, I don‚Äôt have family or friends close to me. I can‚Äôt even reach my goals cuz I‚Äôm always in a rut. 

Sometimes the best option feels like going away forever. I‚Äôve thought of running and starting new. Maybe not being here anymore. Sorry for this ramble."

1353,depression,Struggling because of my teeth.,"Im 22 and I didnt start brushing my teeth until about 5 years ago. I started brushing twice a day and flossing every day for the past 2-3 years.

I've had gingivitis on my botton two canine teeth and one or two of my incisors for years.

No matter how much I brush or floss, it hasnt gone away. I've had two different dentists in the past few years and they both just told me to keep brushing and flossing even though thats what I do. i know im doing it correctly because ive watched tons of videos on proper technique.


My current dentist doesnt even mention the gingivitis unless I do. 

For all I know its progressed into periodontitis by now. I asked my current dentist and they said it didnt, but I found it odd that they never measured my gum pockets during any of my visits like my previous dentists did. 


It just feels like im destined to lose my teeth, and like im trying to fight for something that I cant stop.

Im probably making it into a bigger deal than it is but its just really stressful everytime I see my inflamed gums."
1354,depression,Why is hating life so stigmatized?,"When someone is suicidal , it's self implied that one hates themselves.

Why would I hate myself when I did nothing wrong? If life failed me every bit of the way, why should I hate myself?

And may the Lord forgive you if you ever mention you hate life , people will think of you as a sub-human.

Work 50 years to enjoy 11 if you even make it past 30?

Point this out to anyone? You're mentally ill and need your zoloft-lithium-kissmyass-normalpills to take every sense of realism out of you (I do not hate on antidepressants , they helped me too).

Not only do I not belive that I'm mentally ill , I belive that everyone who doesn't hold these beliefs or similar about life are the ones that are mentally ill.

Life is a rat race."

I have had depressive episodes before but never like this. Usually when I get low I focus all of my energy on school and I really care how my grades are. This time though I cannot care, like I do care but nothing in me gets me out of bed to go to class. I‚Äôve skipped all parties and trips that my friends have gone to for the past 3 weeks because I could tell I was getting to a breaking point. I haven‚Äôt been to a single class in a week and a half and missed tons of work and 2 exams. I have been doubling my vyvanse every morning in hopes that it will give me some form of motivation to get up and do even one assignment but it has done nothing. 

Today my roommates told me they are all moving out and I have less than 2 days now to either sign my lease or move for the next school year. All of my friends have already got their situations figured out so I will probably spend my senior year alone in an apartment. For some reason this situation broke me it pushed me over the edge and I‚Äôm not holding it together anymore. I am so tired so disappointed in myself so lonely and so embarrassed. 
I am going to drive home to my parents tomorrow and tell them that I need help. I am scared to let them down but I am not ok."
1358,depression,I Hate the Night,"I‚Äôm just going through a breakup with a girl who I loved so much, but it just wasn‚Äôt healthy for either of us and I felt like I needed to end it. I‚Äôve struggled with being extremely lonely all my life and never really had any friends or in my few friends groups I was the odd one out; the one that walked behind the group on a narrowed sidewalk, you get what I mean, and was always rejected by every girl I‚Äôve ever asked out until this girl I just broke up with, and I‚Äôm really struggling with the loneliness now that she‚Äôs gone. I have severe anxiety and depression and it makes it super hard to sleep and all I want to do is just text her and call her for the night, even if it‚Äôs just one night that I can forget everything that happened just I can relax and sleep well. I know the answer should be obvious, but should I go down the other path?"

1360,depression,Do you feel like you just let life happen to you?,"I never made something happen to me myself.
I never took control over something in my life.
I never made a real decision.
I never worked for anything.
I never pursued a partner actively.



How do you take control over your life? How do you know what you want or love?
I feel that I will always circle around depression if I do not find the the thing that drives me.
There is no ambition or love for any tasks in me.
I don't know if my hobbies are actual interests or just a mode to pass the time. 
Same as sleeping. I am sleeping so much because it is like getting time over faster.
I could do so much instead!


I am not suicidal, but I feel it would make no difference. A few people would be sad upon my death, but since I am not really living, just existing, it would not make a difference to me I feel.

Still I wish for myself a real life. I want a loving partner and kids (and with 31 it is kind of getting late). I want a real job, not to be abused as a cheap worker. I want to love my hobbies. I want to have a good nights sleep instead of 12 hours of trying to pass the time.
But I nothing enough to really put in any work."
1361,depression,It‚Äôs not stopping,"I‚Äôm usually able to push through and function and then inevitably wait out the cycle. But it‚Äôs just relentless this time around. I can‚Äôt do shit at work, I can‚Äôt talk to my wife, I can‚Äôt play with my kids, I feel like I‚Äôm being ran over a fucking cheese grater. This shit is brutal."
1362,depression,I was feeling the most ready I ever felt and still failed miserably,"It‚Äôs gonna sound pathetic but, I had my driving exam a few days back, and it was the first time since ever I felt like I could actually achieve something. I felt SO capable. And what you know I made 2 eliminatory mistakes which I NEVER did before. 

Stayed up all night updating for the results as if the Universe was going to change it somehow lol. 

I know failures aren‚Äôt that big of a deal, but that‚Äôs all I was holding myself onto for the past few months. 

So I do be feeling like utter shit rn. üòÇ"
1363,depression,üòê,I might end this shit soon. I can deal living for nothing. My life has no purpose and at this point I‚Äôm just living for other people. I can‚Äôt do this no more.

1364,depression,I dont know anymore,"Im 17 and its my last year in high school I barely talk to anyone because i‚Äôm so insecure, but I just feel like no one would even notice me if i went missing at all. back at my old school people knew about me but like they only thought I was that quiet kid and I was even called a school shooter by some people. I just don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt talk to people i‚Äôm not great at anything, the only thing I do is play video games and thats where i get to be free and talk to people but always in the end im alone with no one to talk to. I really don‚Äôt enjoy doing anything video games are starting to get boring to me I just want something to do in my life and not be a shut in for most of it."

1366,depression,Trouble sleeping,"For the past couple months, ive been waking up in the middle of the night, more than once sometimes and have trouble going back to sleep. Its been a while where I just had a straight 7 hours a sleep. I just get too stressed and anxious about where I am in life and how much of a loser I am. I think too much about the things I desperately want but dont have, and grow jelous of people which also doesnt help getting back to sleep faster. I try to compensate this by taking naps in the afternoon but I just feel awful after waking up from a nap but oh well."
1367,depression,"I don‚Äôt post much, but I‚Äôm not sure what else to do.","So I want to start off by saying that I‚Äôm not diagnosed however I did talk to my doctor about the way I‚Äôve been feeling not too long ago (about a month and a half ago) and he gave me some meds.


I‚Äôm posting here in seek of people who may be able to help me get a little bit of insight on how to get out of this rut I‚Äôm in. I‚Äôm a 25 year old man, who still lives with his parents and hasn‚Äôt had a relationship since 2014. I can‚Äôt seem to hold down a job and I left my last one because my mental health hit an all time low. The biggest part is, when I think about getting a nine to five, I just shut down and start to think ‚Äúwhy do I want to work and then just die, might as well just go now, life isn‚Äôt worth it if all I‚Äôm ever going to do is chase money‚Äù and things of that sort. It‚Äôs not a good spot to be in cause I actually do have a few responsibilities I need taken care of. I don‚Äôt want to work a job that I don‚Äôt LOVE because then I won‚Äôt be happy, but all of these boring jobs, I know I won‚Äôt be super interested in and honestly the thought of working something that I don‚Äôt look forward to doing every single day fills me with apathy and lethargy and just downright sadness. Any input is welcome. Sorry if this isn‚Äôt the place for the post, but I don‚Äôt know where else to go. Thanks in advance."

1369,depression,Its almost like im paying the price for being depressed,"I sleep all day because i want to sleep away the depression. I go to bed at 4am and wake up at 6pm. The whole day is gone. Whatever. But what really makes me hate this depression is the concept of not being able to live properly due to a massive chain reaction. Heres that

I dont have a job and have been rejected by every company, this then leads to no income. My only income is government support getting only $400 a month. 

I am living on the edge everyday, cant go out and its on a constant groundhog day loop of being in between 50-70$ saved after rent etc. then random things come up like bills etc. What does this then lead to? No good food to buy. I resort to then getting takeaway, this leads to weight gain, this leads to me become an ugly version of myself, which then leads to not being wanted by anyone, rejected by dating sites etc. it is fucking endless. Whats the root? Money.
Then things like doing chores etc all because i want to sleep away the depression. Im scared to move because if i do i feel like i might die. It all mounds up over time which then leads to stress. Im contemplated suicide multiple times but pull it off as a joke when my friend ask if im ok. I feel like most people have their shit together at 25. Im just beginning this hell hole."
1370,depression,Spiraling,"This past year I have become a version of myself that I didn‚Äôt even think was possible. I‚Äôve become everything I hate. I was so bored stuck at home that I began drinking to pass the time. My drinking became excessive and absolutely destroyed my mental health while severely damaging my relationship. After spending some time in the mental hospital, I was finally put on meds (Zoloft, Wellbutrin, buspirone). I no longer have negative thoughts, unnecessary guilt, or self hatred. But I also do not have any motivation to do anything. All I want to do is sleep. I‚Äôm going completely broke from missing so many shifts at work. Ive ruined my boyfriends trust by lying about multiple stupid things. I can‚Äôt do a single productive thing or even have a creative thought unless I abuse some kind of stimulant. I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing, where I‚Äôm going, and I just don‚Äôt care. Why is it so hard to want to live life? I have no desire to do anything at all. Waking up is absolutely dreadful because the thought of having a busy day cripples me. I feel like I‚Äôm just rambling making no sense. Can anyone else relate?"
1371,depression,My life is worthless,I don‚Äôt think my partner will ever propose and it‚Äôs been so long that I genuinely don‚Äôt see any meaning in life anymore. I want to kill myself. If he doesn‚Äôt want a future with me then what‚Äôs the point? I feel like I‚Äôm spiralling out of control.
1372,depression,Scar fix,"If anyone has self harm scars that are bad, I recommend using cocoa butter vaseline and rub it in with a lot of force and massage it in for like at least 15 minutes. And massage it in each direction and circles. I had to do it a lot to get my scar down but I got my scar down tremendously, it was a big puffed up one. I‚Äôve had to do it multiple days , many, maybe like a couple weeks worth of days and a lot of doing it but getting my scar to look better and go away is making me more confident and just enough happier for it to be worth it. just my advice, I hope i can help at least one person&lt;3"
1373,depression,Please someone help me,"So, this is random, but I just wanted to say being alone is terrible. These past few months, in fact the whole past year has really been a garage fire. I've lost almost everyone. And, basically everything. I struggle to live, minute by minute. Knowing that when I go home, at the end of the day, there's just a blank wall staring back at me. And I have no one to blame but myself. I try to fight it, I say that I found something new to bring me meaning or joy; but it's all fleeting. So I can't help but sit there and ache. Everything hurts, everything is worse, and I have no one to tell about it. I make desperate pleas and cries for help and attention, but the theater is empty. I always said, the shit show must go on. But, what about when everyone is tired and wants to go home? Are you simply to keep them there, cause you don't have a home. Who are you to put a show on for, if no one is ever gonna bother.. it's terrifying. I'm scared, and I know I'm not, truly alone. But this sure does feel like it. And everyday when I go to work and a coworker or a customer asks me how I'm doing, I just wanna break down and tell him how it's all so terrible and beg them to tell me how do they manage? How do they keep going every day? How? Cause I don't know what, or who I even am anymore."
1374,depression,I‚Äôm tired of going nowhere,"I feel so shitty. People are so ugly and mean to each other it sucks. I missed a dose of my antidepressants because I‚Äôve been giving it my all at work. People put me down because I make mistakes. I‚Äôm trying to learn. 

I think I‚Äôm getting close to the end of my life. I‚Äôve been having nightmares and thoughts of just being done with it. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Everything I do, doesn‚Äôt matter. I just want to get passed all this.


I hope I make it. But I‚Äôm starting to doubt I will. Anyway, thanks for listening."
1375,depression,Life is being a disappointment,"- Home all day because of lockdown

- Lost touch with friends, never got contacted back when i stopped

- Barber messed up my haircut

- Feeling of being avoided or ignored whenever I try to make online friends

- Keep seeing couples having fun or just hanging out whenever I try to take a walk by myself to clear my mind

- Fighting with inferiority complex, self esteem issues, loneliness everyday

- Feeling pressured and stressed about my future

This either sounds like a comedy movie or just a sad hopeless movie. These things may sound small or not too much compared to what people go through. But feeling all of them all together, every single day, is really. exhausting for me. Hope life gets on a steady wheel soon. I try, but sometimes I feel its also based on my luck‚Ä¶ which you can assume how good it is. Thanks for reading."
1376,depression,I (M17) hate my life.,"First of all I just want to say that I am blessed with my life situation. My parents are well off, and I have a roof and food on the table. My situation is way better than most, but yet I still don't feel complete. 

I simply would like advice for what you would do in my situation, I know there's a lot you guys out there some wisdom to drop. 

I live in the Philippines, and we are still in lockdown. I'm American Indian, and a majority of the foreigners in the country have left due to covid, and even though I lived here my whole life, it just doesn't feel like home. I don't speak the language in this country, and I feel so out of place. I have many acquaintances, but only 2 real friends (4 of my real friends moved away). I miss having a deep connection with a woman, but due to covid, I can't go out and meet many people like I used to, and I have to settle for the girls in my grade, who I don't connect with. I go to school online, and spend majority of my week on zoom, and I spend hours after school studying. I just feel like I'm losing options. I do still have some people that I get to see, but I still feel so lonely.

I've been training really hard in the gym and for Muay Thai, while doing things to try and keep my mind right. That's been keeping me somewhat composed. Yet, I just feel like it's not enough. 

In 10 months I can leave this country, and go to Uni in the US, but that just feels like years away. Everyday I feel like I'm going deeper and deeper into a hole. I don't want to be in this bullshit cycle anymore. 

I know that life isn't all fun and games, and I can't control everything, but I just feel like I should be doing something more."

1378,depression,It's a wonder to myself too.,"It's a mystery and a frightening one as to how casually I think of suicide in my daily life.

Does anyone else feel like that?"
1379,depression,every day is the same,"the days blend together, i don‚Äôt keep track of what day it is anymore. my parents even worry about that, they ask me what day it is and almost everytime i say ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know‚Äù. it‚Äôs like the same day replays over and over, i wake up, eat, sleep again, play games, sleep. nothing exciting ever happens and i only have myself to blame. i enjoy being alone and isolating myself, yet i complain about being alone and feeling lonely. it‚Äôs my fault but i can‚Äôt help it. i don‚Äôt even know what i feel anymore? these antidepressants are doing exactly what i worried about, theyre making me numb. i cant cry anymore, i feel no emotion."

Therapy isn‚Äôt working and life is looking more useless to endure. I hate having to suffer with these thoughts but suicide crossed my mind often.

My mom was‚Ä¶ in hindsight I would say she was probably dealing with some trauma herself. She‚Äôs not a nurturing person, despite being the stay at home mother who raised me and my brothers and sisters.

When my wife and I started dating, she had to initiate physical contact. Hugging was never something my family ever did growing up. When I went to college and people were hugging each other, I was honestly confused. It‚Äôs become this joke in our marriage about how she had to teach me how to hug.

Rationally, I know there are people in my life who love me. My parents would say they love me, though they have always been abysmal at expressing that in any meaningful way. I‚Äôm sure my wife loves me, though it seems like half the time we‚Äôre just tolerating each other, or too busy coping with the firehose of bullshit that is adult life. I have three kids. I‚Äôm sure they love me, though it really feels like most of the time I‚Äôm with them they are literally screaming at me. I guess I have friends who would probably say they love me, but I don‚Äôt really see any friends ever. My siblings would say they love me. I don‚Äôt see them very often. 

While writing this, my son came up and asked if we could cuddle. I should feel warmth at this. I put my kids to bed tonight. They all hugged and kissed me and told me they loved me. But I just don‚Äôt feel it. I feel tired and empty.

My brain doesn‚Äôt feel or think positive, nice things about itself. I really, really don‚Äôt have those neural pathways. I also don‚Äôt know what to do about that. I don‚Äôt like myself, or enjoy my life."

I am worthless
I am meaningless
I am nothing 
I am unlovable 
I am undeserving 
I am a burden and a nuisance 

My marriage is in ruins because of my anger, depression, and anxiety. He shut down years ago. He doesn't see how that fed into where I am at now. He doesn't see that the emotional withholding he has done for years and years and years has eroded me to the point of nothingness. My soul is heavy yet empty. A black hole of sorrow. His pointing at my already known flaws only make me want to punish myself more. I was invisible to him unless I came in like a storm. Full of fury and pain. Now that is the cause of these ruins. 

Our beautiful life was built on lies. He never really loved me. If he did he wouldn't have cheated from the start. He wouldn't have become a ghost while standing next to me. An empty shell of a man who shows me no emotion. A man who seeks out emotional connections in friends and other women but never me. I shouldn't be surprised, no one can love me forever. I am only good enough for temporary. 

I am stupid
I am fat
I am lazy
I am ugly
I am disgusting 

A lifetime of not being enough. A lifetime of failure. A lifetime of being used. A lifetime of being disposable. I have suffered trauma after trauma and am too weak to grow the f*** up and move on. Instead it weighs me down. The tendrils of my  shame and guilt. Of pain and fear pull me further into oblivion. 

Trauma calls for me in every fiber of my being. A mocking menace whispering screams of my internal agony. Burning hot skin meets the cold blade of steel.  Moon pale skin with raised trails of these broken dreams. Ruby ribbons of tears streak across the white fields of flesh. A moment of physical releases let's me escape from this internal damnation. 

The echoes of all I have seen. Of all I have felt burned themselves into my very existence. I deserved it all. The wandering greedy hands of my friends brother when I was seven. I had a crush and must have let myself be lured by his charm. 

The constant shouts of my stupidity from my father. The sudden quick lash of his violence. A smack on the head. A kick to the chest. Rare but oh so sudden.. Like lightning on a blue sky day. I dared be born a girl thus I was less lovable than his son. If I didn't screw up he wouldn't need to show me the ways.

The disappointed teachers who never saw my actions a cry for help but instead me being defiant and a brat. The isolation in a locked room. The burn of shame on my face as they scold me yet again. I should have just used my words instead of being an impossible little shit. 

Waking in the purple darkness of dawn naked in his dorm room sore and confused. Sneaking out like a thief with stolen shorts and crumpled shirt. Feeling a sickness I've never known before as I pass his door again and again and again to see my underwear hanging there, a flag of my slutiness. The words of confusion tumbling from my mouth to friends and campus counselors only to be told I was mistaken. I am saying this because I have regret. Causing me to question my own sanity. The blame is at my feet. Even a friend with a Coke can't be trusted. 

I am a whore

In the past I was nothing. Today it's the same. Nothing has changed but the physical vessel carrying the burdens of all my yesterday's. Now I am failing not just myself but those I love the most. 

I am a bad daughter
I am a bad sister
I am a bad friend
I am a bad wife
the worst of it all is 
I am am bad mother

My children deserve more than me. I don't want to ruin them. I wake everyday to do better and I always fall short. I know tonight I wallow in these thoughts but tomorrow I will rise because I can't destroy their lives by catastrophically leaving. 

I know if my husband reads this he will only hate me more. I just need to speak these words to someone other than myself. I am here. This is me trying."
1415,depression,Battling depression on and off.,"I have been struggling with depression on and off for the past 4-5 years, can't really say how long, but it has gotten even worse for the past year.

A little back story, in the country I love in mental health is not really consider an issue, people just say ""put your head up and it will off be fine"" , or "" just man up there's nothing wrong with you"", ""stop talking bullshit and start working"", no one really exempts the fackt that depression is a real issue. I am a 30 year old male, I have a somewhat good job with good pay, company car that is all payed for and included gas for personal use aswell, but the issue is I don't really get days off, I am always working. I just might be burned out by now, but the reality of it is, that even if I am not at work I am constantly thinking of work, what I did wrong what could have been done better why didn't I do it like this or that, it makes my life miserable, I have turned to alcohol, and not really sleeping all too well aswell, I can't really stop myself from drinking, and that is just not good for me. I have limited my contacts with friends I am not reliable for myself or for my friends and family, I just don't see a point in continuing to do anything...

P. S I know this post is not really constructed but I just needed to say all these things, since there is no one to say them to..."
1416,depression,The urge is strong tonight,My eyes hurt from crying. I don‚Äôt want to be here. I don‚Äôt want to feel pain anymore. I‚Äôll try to sleep the pain away. I think I‚Äôll take a melatonin and go to bed.
1417,depression,I‚Äôm tired of living,"The title should be enough but if not, I‚Äôm tired of living. I can‚Äôt ever be happy. It‚Äôs like the second something good happens in my life it just gets taken away. And on top of all of that my girlfriend doesn‚Äôt love me anymore. She was my only source of happiness and I lost her. I did everything for her, when she needed a shoulder to cry on I was there, when people disrespected her I made sure they stopped. I made sure she was always happy. But it‚Äôs like, no matter how hard I try I‚Äôll never be enough. I just want to be happy. I did everything for this girl, I‚Äôve sacrificed so much for her all for her to leave me. Why couldn‚Äôt I be enough? All I do is fuck up. Sorry about this all, it‚Äôs just a bunch of random shit put together. I‚Äôm just tired of living."
1418,depression,My best friend is severely depressed and quit her meds cold turkey and isn‚Äôt acting like herself *TW*,"I don‚Äôt know how to help her. We have been best friends for YEARS. We even loved together as roommates for quite a few. She has struggled with depression basically her whole life. I have always been a support system for her. And I thought I had seen her bad episodes (I knew her when she almost made an attempt) but I have never seen anything like this. 

Unfortunately we don‚Äôt live together any more but I try to visit or talk on the phone as much as possible and she changed. She is still honest to me about her symptoms for the most part which I appreciate as it makes it easier for me to help her but I don‚Äôt know what to. She has been suicidal the past three months, isolating her self from friends and family (only talking to me because I make her and that was hard to do) she hasn‚Äôt been eating and has been nearly fainting at work as a result, she has no regard for future consequences (she was fine with the potential of going to jail) she is not keeping up with basic life necessities and is completely reliant on her boyfriend to survive (it‚Äôs not an abusives relationship he really cares about her but I believe they may be codependent). 

She stated that her dissociation and suicidal thoughts have gotten worse so she decided to quit her meds last week. She was on a very high dose and was on this led for over a year. Not something you can just quit without talking to a doctor. 

When she was really down I sent her the numbers to some local crisis lines and she got mad at me saying she can‚Äôt afford to be hospitalized. I told her they are just numbers to talk and are free they can‚Äôt hospitalize you but she didn‚Äôt want to hear it. 

I don‚Äôt know what do. In the last bad period a few years ago where she almost attempted I was able to get her to go to therapy and it was really helping for a while. But now she is isolating herself from even her therapist. I am absolutely terrified that I am going to get a call that I was too late and that she is gone. 

Is there anything I can do?"

1423,depression,I‚Äôm in a bad place at the moment,"I guess I just want to put my thoughts out into the void, but also think I need the positive feedback. 

I‚Äôm in NSW (Australia) and the entire state is in lockdown. I imagine the way I‚Äôm feeling is pretty indicative for most at the moment. I have two jobs and I am unable to work at either at the moment as they are both retail and deemed inessential. I‚Äôm beginning to worry that one of them may close as it is a small business and my boss is seriously struggling. 

For the last week and a half, I‚Äôve felt sad every day. There were little glimmers of normalcy, but an overarching misery. Something snapped last night though and now I oddly feel nothing. I‚Äôm not happy, but I‚Äôm not sad either. I just feel totally impartial to everything, I don‚Äôt know how to explain it. I just have nothing to say to anyone, I don‚Äôt want to do anything. Nothing makes me feel really angry or annoyed like it did, like traffic, but nothing makes me feel happy or excited either, like buying food. There‚Äôs just nothing. 

I live with my boyfriend and I‚Äôve just been feeling so lonely and disconnected from him at the moment. Most nights he‚Äôs lying up the other end of the couch cuddling our dog and I don‚Äôt know how to tell him how desperately I need a cuddle. Last time I did he laughed because he thinks I‚Äôm jealous of the dog, which I guess I am, which is so stupid. 

Ultimately, everything just feels so endless and futile. I feel so trapped. We‚Äôre all living in limbo. I can‚Äôt make any plans or decisions to get out of this mental rabbit hole because no one knows what‚Äôs happening or when there will be a light at the end of the tunnel."
1424,depression,How do I convince myself to eat sth?,"I nearly lost all appetite and therefore don't really eat anything, which really doesn't help my depression.

The funny thing is I try to get help from the last 3 years each time I get thrown away. First time they did care then just forget about it never got the help i need. Second time Covid hit making it hard to ask anyone‚Ä¶ 3rd time‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ hurt. To be honest im at the end. I think about death. All i want is death.. All i want is to sleep and never wake up. And these pills making it vary hard to say no. Idk were im getting at with this but ik no one going read this sob story. I guess to get some thoughts down depending on the path I choose to take tonight. If someone did read it i hope you can find help and not end up like me‚Ä¶.
1428,depression,I‚Äôm the biggest disappointment in the world,"I hate myself for the following reasons: I‚Äôm lazy, I don‚Äôt have a passion in life. My biggest fear in life is my parents hating me. Not in the sense that they kick me out and leave me homeless etc. that won‚Äôt happen. In the sense that they hate me as a person. I‚Äôm not like them, they do everything fast and quick, and do it well. My dad started from nothing and managed to give me a wonderful life. Me on the other hand, I had everything handed to me and I couldn‚Äôt do anything with it. I‚Äôm 20 and I hate myself. I wish I wanted to go to college, and if not, I wish I had some kind of talent so I could build my life around it. Sadly I don‚Äôt, there‚Äôs gonna be a day in my near future where my parents begin to look at me as the worlds biggest failure and that they regret having me or wish they had a kid who wasn‚Äôt useless. The bar was never set high for me, but I couldn‚Äôt even do the bare minimum. All I do is cry all day in my room but my parents haven‚Äôt noticed because I lock myself and I cry silently. I just need this feeling to go away. It‚Äôs so scary to think that life is just one big disappointment. Maybe I was wired this way or maybe I fucked it up. It‚Äôs been weeks and my heart is heavy all the time in fear and panic."

1430,depression,about beauty,"well, I have this little monologue about the word I love and hate.

Sometimes I think about what beautiful is, who taught you the reader,who taught me what beautiful is.All I see is that I am far from beautiful and those Instagram people I see are breathtakingly beautiful sometimes it makes me cry looking at them so I don't. Social media has,at least on me burned those two or three stereotypes of perfect beauty and of course I am like most p

eople not them.I wonder if I was those having popularly celebrated features, If I know myself correctly wouldn't have been writing this. But really what is beauty, what is physically attractive, I have many famous and normal people I find beautiful, but its not me, its just not me because I don't have that eyes, that jaw,that body that face.

Every time I look in the mirror, I try to make the reflection look but I can't, It doesn't stop looking anything but ugly. I use things to get that perfect skin ,hair and everything,but nothing works, I can't look at the mirror without despising what I see.

I would not mention my insecurities because it makes me feel like people will be out to get me, even they people who love and care about me beyond physical attraction, I never tell them because even when they do not care, I don't want any human to see and take notice. My loved ones try to tell me that external beauty doesn't matter and that I'm still pretty nevertheless but I cannot believe them when I try to.

People are obsessed with their beauty and I'm obsessed with my ugliness. Why am I so shallow for myself, why am I kind to everyone but me. At the end of the day, I hate to admit it but I wish I looked like those girls I want to be the universally accepted beautiful.

Anyone would tell me I'm one of the kindest and empathetic person they have met in a while but I'm shallow to me, I'm unkind to me. Frankly I hate me.

I'm not beautiful,and I believe I cant change that, I hate me and I cant change that, I hurt everyday when I see myself but I guess I can learn to live with that.

I'm just okay because I have beautiful souls that care for me. Guess I will keep writing sharing these hateful monologue to myself.

Thank you for reading."

1438,depression,Still trying to cope with my best friend‚Äôs suicide,"Hey guys, pretty much what the title says. I‚Äôd like to provide some context though. 

I guess one could say I‚Äôm a ‚Äúveteran‚Äù of mental illness; I‚Äôve been dealing with panic disorder and social anxiety with undiagnosed depression (which I believed to be a byproduct of my anxiety) for about 13 years. Throughout high school, my friend and I helped each other through very difficult and dark times. Both growing up as an only child, we eventually considered ourselves as brothers, given how much we‚Äôd see each other. This past summer I had come back from my final year in college to see him and about three weeks in, he took his own life. Of course at first it was VERY difficult; simply an assortment of emotions that is impossible to describe over text. I thought I had started to feel better about a month after‚Ä¶ probably from all the drinking, but now everything is just going to shit. All I can feel now is hatred and sadness. The only times I can remotely feel happiness are for mundane, stupid things such as making a cool play in a video game in which the artificial happiness only lasts for a short time. I mentioned my experience with mental illness before, because I have dealt with all of this and felt as though I almost conquered it with no medication, but what I‚Äôve been feeling recently is something much more intense and dark. Honestly never felt this lost in my life and I need help."

1441,depression,Can I be treated for depression without admitting I have suicidal thoughts to my doctor?,"For the first time in my life, I‚Äôm looking to get professional help and I‚Äôd like some advice based on other people‚Äôs experiences first.

My issue is that I don‚Äôt want to admit I have suicidal thoughts to anyone, not even the doctor I‚Äôm visiting in case my parents request a copy of my medical information. I also can‚Äôt go to therapy for it at the moment anyway and out of all other symptoms, I feel least emotionally ready to talk about that one or the attempt I‚Äôve made in the past.

My parents are, for the most part, homeopathic and I‚Äôm listed as a dependent under their insurance plan. I‚Äôm both neglected and kept on a very tight leash if that makes sense‚Ä¶ (E.g. only being taken to the dentist once my teeth were already heavily deteriorated.) I‚Äôm no longer a minor, but I still live with them and I can‚Äôt drive myself anywhere or maintain a job as I‚Äôm mentally crippledn nor do I have friends to help me.

I‚Äôve managed to land a doctor‚Äôs visit under the guise of fainting from frequent migraines (which is true). My parents are paying for it, and fortunately they can‚Äôt tell the difference between a neurologist and a psychiatrist in case of a referral.

I‚Äôm planning to bring up depression to the doctor at the same time while using all personal my part-time money to pay for any separate medication. But will diagnosis or treatment change if I omit important facts like suicide? I want to quickly get better, focus, and leave this place. I can‚Äôt afford be locked by my parents.

I know next to nothing about going to the doctor‚Äôs. So maybe none of this is a valid concern‚Ä¶?

Also how do these things go?? Growing up in a homeopathic environment has left me clueless."

1448,depression,What's the Point?: A Cureless Existence.,"Clinical depression is an imbalance of chemicals in your brain that causes depression.
We have way to measure the levels of these chemicals.
We don't know what the ""good level"" is (supposedly its different for everyone?)
We have no idea how much a given dosage of a given drug is going to affects the levels in someone's brain.
And even if you're lucky enough to get on a drug dose that works...there's a high chance you'll have to stay on it forever and even a chance that it will become ineffective and you will have to be put something else.
Honestly, I am just tired of it...I don't want to deal with it anymore because it is exhausting.
And being told that you will mostly likely be dealing with something you have no control over for the rest if your life makes me wonder: is it even worth it?"

Sometimes foreign customers come to the grocery store that I work. They've surprised to hear an average cashier talking in English, sometimes I make small conversations with foreigners. Some local customers even congratulate me because of my English speaking capability. I want to use this talent at a job. Translator would be a good option. But can I do it ? I don't know. What if I fail ? If I can't be a translator what can I do ? Being in tech industry. For example ; a game designer, software engineer, programmer, information technology, web designer etc... Perhaps I've got a talent for designing a web site. I graduated from web design division of my high school. Maybe I can make an income from this. Who knows ? What happens if this doesn't work ? I've got one more option. Being a photographer or a cameraman. I've had an enthusiasm about photography a year ago. This wouldn't be a bad idea. Being a photographer or a cameraman. What if this doesn't work ? Well, I'm out of options. The only way to get out is death. I'll commit suicide if I don't have a job and career in the future. Let's imagine for a minute. Me, a 30 years old grown ass man, unemployed, his mom and dad were died, his brother and sister left him alone. He's about to go insane. His past haunted him, with failures, mistakes, wrongdoings, bad decisions. He cry every time. He wanna go back to his childhood but he can't. He can't sleep, he can't eat, he just want to be dead. He picks up a gun. Shove it to his mouth, pulled the trigger, and bang ! He's gone. Will he rest in peace ? I don't think so. Because nobody knew about him. As if he wasn't lived. He's just an another fuel for the soil. He'll be vanished. 

I don't want to be like that. What the fuck I will do ? I DONT FUCKING KNOW !!! 

I gotta make a roadmap. But I can't. I FUCKING CAN'T. Because some cunt will be a manager or boss in a goddamn job with his father's help. In spite I worked like a slave. Road has some traps that I can't dismiss. May god help me and others. I lost my hope. There's no hope."

I‚Äôve been on mirtazapine since February and they have been a godsend, i am now able to sleep for once in my life.
I feel like I‚Äôve hit another obstacle in my life, I just generally feel unhappy with life. I constantly worry about my girlfriends happiness which is putting a big strain on my relationship. I find i spiral out of control easily with my emotions , all it takes is something i dont agree  with and I find myself in a pit of despair. I constantly argue with co workers. I always feel like I‚Äôve forgotten to do something when there isn‚Äôt anything out standing. 
Im unsure what type of help I need , looking for some insight please guys"

1465,depression,Such a waste,"I wish that I could feel better. I probably should get back to using anti-depressants, but I am afraid of side effects. 

I am not sure that I can do much to make things better for myself. It's not so much that I was dealt some bad cards - most people get that -, it's also my character and extremely low self-esteem.

Some years ago I did make an effort, and for a while I managed a few things - nothing great, but something. Mostly succeeded in securing some income, although barely enough to be able to sustain myself. During those years, I did come across a few women and went on dates, but ultimately I never felt secure enough to go beyond that, and they picked it up and gave up on me.

I also was in therapy, though mostly prior to all that - and for a full decade, with two psychiatrists. Maybe the first one just didn't suit me at all, and I wasted 8 years there. The second one was better suited to me, but then money problems forced me to stop going.

It's just all a very sad story. I do know from experience that your mood can change drastically, even with almost everything else staying the same. But many days I can't even bear to look myself at the mirror.

I had deep depression since I was in highschool, but I am now approaching middle age, and I don't like at all how I find myself at times concluding my loop of depressive thoughts with the idea that - if it comes to that - I could just kill myself, so for the time being I could hang on for a while longer to see if things improve.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this is my post. I don't think it can help anyone. Rather sounds bleak, even by my standards :) I guess I will just take the anti-depressants again, and try to continue."
1466,depression,"my boyfriend is severely depressed, and sent me the following texts.","please tell me, what should i do? it breaks my heart to see him like this. (he talks about our relationship and his life situation in general. 
pd: he recently started going to therapy)

The texts:

‚ÄúThere are acts that can be very valuable but to no avail. I have known for months that it is a lost and absurd battle that is not worth fighting and things have happened accordingly and got worse. We could not do it separately, nor together, we could not do it in more favorable situations, we cannot do it now it would simply be absurd. It would be better for you to dedicate your time to yourself or anything else.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is simply useless already, it was useless half a year ago and it is now more than ever. There‚Äôs no need on making a great effort if it has to be useless.‚Äù

‚ÄúI consider the help (not yours but from anyone) useless given the situation, and I think time has proved me right.‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything has gone from bad to worse, it would be absurd to think that things could work out.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn December I told you that no matter how much you wanted it was not viable, that it would become a struggle between you and depression and that we could not win in any way, and everything has happened like this, I am able to distinguish my thoughts from reality yet.‚Äù

It is very heartbreaking to see him like this. He has said these things to me many times, so it doesn‚Äôt come as a surprise to me that he thinks this way, but it is still hard. He always ends up coming back to me, and I want to be supportive of him and do whatever I have to do best so it allows him to feel at least a bit safer with me. 59 feel that he is actually not alone and that getting better is not impossible, but he keeps pushing me away. what should I really do?"

1469,depression,i feel disconnected,"i feel like i've just been observing my own life rather than living it, if that makes sense.
i am stuck in a really stressful situation and i have no way of coping with it. i have tried crying it out but i don't feel sad enough anymore. the only emotions that i've been able to experience recently are anxiety and anger. 

so much has happened in the past two years that i could literally witness a murder and i dont think it would have an effect on me. everything seems to be losing its meaning to me, even things that would've deeply upset me in the past, or the things that i used to really enjoy and appreciate. 

i hate whats happening to me. its like theres a ball of dread and uneasiness building up inside and i can't really do anything to stop it."

It's not that I don't technically have anybody to talk to, but I'm tired of being a burden to my friends. When I think back about how I used to be, and who I am now, I feel like I'm drowning. I'm taking a degree that I never wanted to do, but I don't have any other alternatives. Everybody is leaving. I'm young, but I feel like my life is already at its end. All that I want is to close my eyes and never wake up again. I've thought about committing suicide several times.

There's not much else to say. I don't see a future for myself anymore, and I haven't for a long time."

1475,depression,advice on depression,"I think I've been struggling with depression for the last couple of years. I've wanted to kill myself but honestly, just have never been able to work up the courage to do it. I want to be able to talk to my family about this, but we don't talk about mental health or anything even remotely similar. At a certain point, I kind of gave up on talking to them and just decided I was going to deal with it until I graduated college and could afford to send myself to therapy. However, I kind of realized that the chances I was going to make it until then aren't great, so I would probably need to do something before. That being the case, I wanted to ask if anyone had any advice on how to talk to my family and how to ask for their support?"
1476,depression,Just speaking my mind. Don't mind me.,I am scared. I am falling into darkness. I am feeling unwell. I am happy in my life. That's how people see me. But I am losing it. I laugh while I sleep. I cry when I wake. I crave death. There are so many methods. It all causes pain. But I can't feel them. I can't process emotions. What is pain? Sounds like something I know. I shall fall into the ocean. I will see darkness. I will panic. I will fight for my life. But eventually I shall get what I asked for. I will be free.
1477,depression,Back in the fog again,"Didn't think I'd be back here again as I thought things in my life were suddenly looking up. I'm currently a semi-professional athlete who's looking to make it full-time. Its been my dream for a very long time and to people on the outside it looking that way. 

However due to injury plus the pandemic I've effectively missed two years of playing. I'm 26(M) and I feel like I've put in a lot of time and effort for very little return. It makes me feel as though I've wasted a lot of time focussing on this one thing and seriously brings me down. 

Coupled with that I've been battling serious anxiety issues since I was in primary school, I worry loads about the future and struggle to think far ahead. I've pursued sports relentlessly as it was the only thing that gave me pure joy and what I thought I was good at. Also making it would provide significant financial reward. 

Seeing friends on social media excel in their respective careers and enjoy life has made me feel as though I've wasted a lot of time and adds to my depression. It also Makes me feel as though I'm not as worth much to people because I'm not doing big thing so I'm not good enough to be around them and more importantly I'm not worth much to myself. 

Since I was young I've never really had people think I could amount to much (aside from my mum) of whom I extremely want to make proud. But overall it has hugely imlacted my mental health to points where I doubt myself and end up asking myself if I've even learnt anything during my time of living. 

I also feel as though since we're now slowly coming out of the pandemic, life as gotten better for most (which is good) but somehow worse for me which may be naive to think but it appears to be that way. To the point whereby I struggle to have simple conversations with people, I don't find things as funny anymore and my attention to detail on things has gone out the window . 

I even feel when writing this message I'm not articulating myself the best as my brain is in a fog at the moment. Doing things such as getting out of bed is becoming an issue but I  feel bad each time if I'm wasting time. I'm struggling to make sense with reality and it's becoming very overwhelming. I don't have money to see a therapist as I quit my job in Sales due to the stress it was bringing and the way it was affecting my performance in sport. 

Overall I've some how wound up in another depressive episode and it seems to be the worst. I thought I was mentally becoming more resilient after okay for a good amount of time but I just  feel lost and confused and it's all happening at a time when things should be going well. 

For people who have experience dealing with this or can relate to this situation in any type of way, what did you do to cope with it and change your lives for the better and permanent."
1478,depression,I missed out on dating in my 20s now.. I am an incel..,"first my teens, and now my 20s, and Im somehow supposed to be content with that and accept it. of course Im pissed off and why wouldnt I be? I missed out on things literally 99% of Earth has done. now I get the pleasure of dating between 3 options, single mothers, girls with triple digit body counts, and obese landwhales. 

my youth is gone, my looks while were already terrible will only get worse, my metabolism and health will only get worse from here on out.. 

of course no one will understand my pain because Im just an incel afterall right. people who have never been lonely sure do seem to have a lot of experience for it dont they? yeah right.. people cant understand how hard it is and how much it tears apart your mental wellbeing completely being alone, like actually alone, not living with your mother alone, like isolated in an apt alone for years, humans are social creatures by nature, our mental state cant cope being lonely for that long. 

if you want proof of that just look at how many normal people cracked just from being in quarantine for a month back in March... now try years because that's my life 

this is kind of a vent but also im suicidal so i doubt ill make it another year. watch my face will end up on another with all the other lonely men who ended  up on [facesofsuicide.com](https://facesofsuicide.com) 

i was honestly just hoping covid would do me in by now. anyways end post"

1481,depression,I feel like I'm suffocating,"I don't know if it's relevant for this post, I'm a 27-year-old woman. My ex of (almost) seven years, broke up with me 5 months ago. We weren't happy, and I think that my diagnosis (Personality disorder(s) with comorbid depression and other stuff), helped him with that decision.   
Because of that, I had to move back to my parents, I can't afford to live alone because my therapy consumes a good chunk of my salary.   
I feel like I'm suffocating like I have this pressure on my chest and throat. It's hard to breathe. I'm constantly on the verge of crying, not because I miss my ex, but because I have this feeling, or rather I'm sure that my life is and is going to be miserable. I see no future and hope for myself.   
I have enough of my life, this neverending vicious cycle, the same routine everyday.  
I wake up, get dressed, go for a walk with my dog, work, go for a walk, exercise, walk the dog.  
Everyday is the same. I eat the same food, wear the same clothes, nothing changes. Or rather I don't change, but everything around me is constantly changing, and I am stuck, slowly suffocating, barely being able to pull my shit together.  
I'm in this place right now, that I would give anything to be able to feel anything, I want to get drunk, high, just to feel something different. I want to meet new people, have affairs, travel, disappear.   
But I can't... I'm stuck in the ivory tower, my prison, my room.   
I try to get out more, be more sociable, but every time I match with someone on a dating app I begin to feel so heartbroken (?) like I know that nothing will ever come out of this because I'm too scared to get out of my room and go on a date. I fear, that they will not like me, find me attractive enough. That's why I stick to texting and ghosting people when they ask me out. I know it's horrible. But I can't help it. I'm a failure, yet I'm so frightened to be perceived as one. And I know that I'm quite good-looking, in good shape, and I can be fun to be around. But lately, I feel like a potato sack, unattractive, with nothing to offer.  
I feel like I'm going to end up all alone, resenting everyone, because they have something, that I won't ever get - happiness and peace of mind.

but i know i won't. i've felt like this before. but i never have the willpower to actually cut myself off from them. i have nothing else in my life and i feel addicted to checking my messages etc so i try to leave but then just come back after a few hours. i'm absolutely pathetic. more reason why i should cut myself off from them. i feel really worthless and stupid and i feel like they secretly can't stand me. i can't stand myself either.

1491,depression,This passage from The Goldfinch made me feel weirdly validated,"‚ÄúBut depression wasn‚Äôt the word. This was a plunge encompassing sorrow and revulsion far beyond the personal: a sick, drenching nausea at all humanity and human endeavor from the dawn of time. The writhing loathsomeness of the biological order. Old age, sickness, death. No escape for anyone. Even the beautiful ones were like soft fruit about to spoil. And yet somehow people still kept fucking and breeding and popping out new fodder for the grave, producing more and more new beings to suffer like this was some kind of redemptive, or good, or even somehow morally admirable thing: dragging more innocent creatures into the lose-lose game. Squirming babies and plodding, complacent, hormone-drugged moms. Oh, isn‚Äôt he cute? Awww. Kids shouting and skidding in the playground with no idea what future Hells awaited them: boring jobs and ruinous mortgages and bad marriages and hair loss and hip replacements and lonely cups of coffee in an empty house and a colostomy bag at the hospital. Most people seemed satisfied with the thin decorative glaze and the artful stage lighting that, sometimes, made the bedrock atrocity of the human predicament look somewhat more mysterious or less abhorrent. People gambled and golfed and planted gardens and traded stocks and had sex and bought new cars and practiced yoga and worked and prayed and redecorated their homes and got worked up over the news and fussed over their children and gossiped about their neighbors and pored over restaurant reviews and founded charitable organizations and supported political candidates and attended the U.S. Open and dined and travelled and distracted themselves with all kinds of gadgets and devices, flooding themselves incessantly with information and texts and communication and entertainment from every direction to try to make themselves forget it: where we were, what we were. But in a strong light there was no good spin you could put on it. It was rotten top to bottom. Putting your time in at the office; dutifully spawning your two point five; smiling politely at your retirement party; then chewing on your bedsheet and choking on your canned peaches at the nursing home. It was better never to have been born‚Äînever to have wanted anything, never to have hoped for anything.‚Äù

1492,depression,Lockdown loneliness,"I just feel lonely from the lack of contact with other people besides my family. There's a lot of an other stuff that gets to me but really the fact that I barely go outside anymore is just telling. Even when I go outside I don't know what to do.

1498,depression,"on the verge of something good, overwhelming sense of doom","I broke up with my first girlfriend almost 3 years ago. Since then I haven‚Äôt met anyone I felt anything for - one hookup, no relationships. Last weekend I went out with a girl and I‚Äôm crazy for her. I‚Äôm seeing her again this Friday. I want to be excited but all I can do is replay our first date in my head over and over and dwell on all the parts where I felt like I fucked up. It didn‚Äôt go bad, but I didn‚Äôt do any kind of flirting or escalation that it feel like a date. I don‚Äôt know how.

She was the one who asked me out, and I can point to things that happened on the date that, in hindsight, signal that she likes me. But that doesn‚Äôt have any affect on how I actually feel about this. I feel like I‚Äôve already blown it by not being great on the first date. I‚Äôm anticipating her cancelling. Even though she had plenty of outs when we were planning it over text, and she took none of them.

It all just feels so tenuous. With my one girlfriend, we texted constantly. Even after the first date, we‚Äôd exchange a few messages a day. With this girl, it‚Äôs maybe one message every few days. And I‚Äôm restraining myself, because I don‚Äôt have anything to say. I‚Äôve been through this enough times to know texting with nothing to say is how you fuck things up.

I‚Äôve just always had such bad luck with this shit that I always feel failure coming. I didn‚Äôt get my first girlfriend until I was 23. Everything before that was rejection either before or after a first date. I feel like I‚Äôm back in college. I‚Äôve been walking around my apartment, doing housework, constantly on the verge of tears. I‚Äôm so fucking twisted up about this. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll deal with it if I fuck this up. Or if I already fucked this up. I‚Äôm tired of being lonely. The days after I realized how much I liked her I felt like a human being with a reason to live for the first time in 3 years. I don‚Äôt want to go back."

1505,depression,Im ready to give up on everything,"I am actually feeling like this because of this event which triggered it (with a big impact on myself in entirety) 

Long story short I met a guy who was 49 at the time on social media, i was fresh out of high school at 19. Fast forward to 2021, i moved to another city for school (which was the same city that he lived in) Me and him dated but it wasnt for long, i really cared for him &amp; loved him. 

Last week, him and fianc√©e was like ‚Äú hey we were wondering if you wanted to come after work for some fun‚Äù basically I went over their house and we all had sex with each other. 

Atferwards we were texting each other for a couple of days. Until one day, they decided they wanted a break from me to work on their ‚Äúrelationship issues‚Äù.  Hearing that made me very depressed &amp; felt like i was used/embarrassed on purpose. 

When i asked about what i did wrong he was like ‚Äú you were being thristy &amp; went overboard with the love you stuff‚Äù my reaction was like , what? I was never thristy and with the love stuff yea did do that; i literally thought she wanted a relationship with me she was saying love u babe and stuff.  


I just need admit to myself the truth, 

I AM A LOSER WHO NO ONE WANTS!"
1506,depression,My only friend the end.....,"This is my first ever reddit post and I'm not sure why I'm doing this. I've never felt this alone. I'm not sure if anyone will even see this. I sure hope someone does even if it is just one person. I'm currently 29 and I've suffered from depression since I was around the age of 18.

I've been in that dark place that many of us have but I always seem to make it out and progress. This time around I'm stuck. The world seems gray. I don' care about many things. Especially myself. I have self worth but I don't have self-love. I don't love myself enough to feel the need to continue and have given up trying to make it out this time around.

My lifestyle doesn't help me too much either. I live a very hermit like life. I've been living off Draftkings for about 2 years now. Therefore, I'm home alone 24-7 watching sports Monday-Sunday because that is my job and how I make a living. The money is great but the life isn't. I rarely talk to anyone anymore.  Shit, I'm a fucking burden to myself  the last thing I want to do is bug anyone with what I'm going through. 

When I was young I pictured a whole different life for me. You know I wanted the regular life to work a 9-5 and raise a family the whole nine. Currently, I don't see a purpose to life/ my life. Truly nothing matters to me anymore. I feel dead. My laughter is fake. My smiles are forced. My emotions don't feel real anymore. 

To me life has no true purpose. Well, I believe the purpose is to be happy but the thing is this is the hardest thing to achieve in life. Pure happiness.  When i say pure I mean constantly happy. We have things that make us happy throughout the day for brief moments. I believe those glimpses of happiness are what keeps some of us pushing. I see no glimpses of happiness lately. My thoughts are wow we are really born into this world just to work and survive. 

Life is sorry as fuck or maybe I'm just the sorry fuck. Idk I just don't care about  many things anymore. Those things that keep someone going and fighting. I don't have the will anymore. I'm complacent here in this dark place where life is gray. Where some want to go and some want to stay.  I don't think I'll be here too much longer. I've had these thoughts just never like this. I'm not asking for help this is just to spill some beans."
1507,depression,Can't believe I'm doing this but fuck it,"kinda just wanna put my thoughts out there into the void but god man. shit really blows right now I'm 20 and I feel like my life has plateaued I dropped out of every form of education I've ever had it feels impossible to get a job and my own fucking parents abandoned me. ""you're an adult now"" is what they keep saying yet why does it feel like I'm 4 again and my dad walked out the door to go fuck some Canadian lass.

I have alot to be greatful for and I am I get frequent flashes of suicidal ideation but I'd never go through with it I always figure that something better will come along y'know? like I'm alive to enjoy this life but rn it feels like I can't enjoy anything all of my passions feel like they're fizzling out and I feel like there really isn't a light at the end of this tunnel.

But the one thing keeping me going is my girlfriend. we're long distance rn which does suck but I truly think she is the love of my life and even if she isint I'm so greatful that she's in my life now I plan on seeing her for my 21st which unbenounced to her November 29th 2021 was my suicide date and I'm really glad that instead of being six feet under with a hole in my head I'll be spending it with her instead.

I know this is a place to kinda doom post and reach out for help (I promise I'm not in any danger) but I think right now I just needed to say how I'm feeling to people and kinda idk validate my existance to prove to myself that I exist and not spiral into dissasociation I understand this isint the best avenue but it's an avenue. 

if you read this thank you I really do appreciate it and I hope that you have a great day friend just incase no one else tells you today"
1508,depression,I don‚Äôt understand how to stop hating myself.,"I have had depression for a long time now. It first developed in middle school and I‚Äôm now a senior in college. I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I should be doing better. I have a girlfriend I‚Äôve been dating for almost 5 years who is loving and supportive I have great family who also take care of me. My friends are great but at the end of the day I still wish I didn‚Äôt exist. I have tried counseling and learned some good coping mechanisms so I‚Äôm not a danger to myself, but I don‚Äôt want to always feel this way. I work out I‚Äôve been losing weight I‚Äôm on track to graduate and have a event career everything should be falling into place, but here I am. Sorry for the long post I just wanted to vent and get my situation out into the world."

1510,depression,another one of those nights.,"It doesn't matter how high i get i always fall even deeper than before, i feel like my chest is hollow, my breathing is shallow, this cold sensation in the air, the weight feels like it's crushing my bones, i try and try and try but i just can't get up, when i can get my chin up the regrets of my past bring it back down

I just want to let go but i can't, i'm so sick and tired, i feel so alone and worst of all, i caused of all of this, i ruined the best thing that has ever happened to me and keep making it worse by trying to fix it"
1511,depression,I feel so worthless.,"Ever since I can remember I have wondered what the purpose of life is. Every day is so dull. I think about suicide often and I can't find motivation to try anything.

I have an addiction to video games because they take me away from my life and my unanswerable questions. I can't sleep at night. I would tell my loved ones but I don't want them to waste their time and energy worrying about me.

I'm not sure when but these feelings amplified recently. I don't know what to do anymore. Is there and point to living? If there is, I don't see it."
1512,depression,I'm so stupid I can't do the smallest tasks properly,"I'm such a disgusting sack of shit who can't do literally anything right. I can't complete the smallest tasks for someone or go through one work day without fucking something up for myself or someone else. 

I'm constantly plagued by the idea that I'm gonna get fired from this job that I need or fuck my gpa up so bad I'll never go to graduate school and never achieve what I want to. 

I feel like I can't do anything right and I'm constantly unable to perform in the way I want to or succeed in the smallest way. My brain and my body are so broken and dysfunctional I don't understand how anyone could see any value in me. 

I just want to be able to sit down and do the things I want to do, take care of my responsibilities and myself but I can't do the smallest things right so why bother xo continuing to try or pretend tomorrow will be the day I figure it out."
1513,depression,Yeahh existing is hard,"We‚Äôll ever since I was a little kid I didn‚Äôt really have a strong will to live I always felt like simply existing was pointless but I always pushed it aside because there were times where I have had fun but after college I‚Äôve had a mental battle on where I should stay or leave this world because YOU HAVE TO EAT, SLEEP, WORK, BUILD CONNECTIONS to live comfortably it also doesn‚Äôt help me want to commit if things in my life aren‚Äôt going the way I want them to I keep messing things up when I think I‚Äôm making them better I think I‚Äôm poison to myself I don‚Äôt want to keep fighting about whether living is something I can do I need help"
1514,depression,Without her my life got emptier than before. I wish I wasn't never born,"It's been 21 days since that day....

21 days since my gf replaced me with her best friend.... She was even AWARE OF MY DEPRESSION. But she's gone....
Even if i was depressed and autistic, I did my best for making her happy. I did my best for not breaking this relationship. I still love her, the wounds didn't recover yet.... My heart still suffers.... With her, my depression was close to disappear.... But now it's back even worse than before. Why do girls hate having depressed bfs? I just wish i wasn't never born, i hate myself with all of myself.... It's all my fault....
Everything is getting worse for me, some days I don't even eat, some days i committed self harm (before of that thing i never did it)..... The pain is immeasurable....
Now I'm alone against the world: this unfair world, my narcissistic family, my summer irl friends (without them I'd feel more alone, i hate winter because it's the worst season)
Already tried to commit suicide 3 times but couldn't do it....
I just want to get out from all this pain and feeling happiness again, but this is an utopia....

ADVICE FOR YOU GUYS: Before starting a relationship, get depression treated and then restart your life step by step, people hate having the atmosphere ""ruined by you""....

Stay safe...."
1515,depression,classic depression symptoms,"i'm 47.  i've been posting on reddit more often because i simply cannot find relief.  i honestly can't tell if this is helping or making it worse.  i've had years of therapy and been on prescription drugs.

constant classic symptoms that i experience every day:  sadness, emptiness, hopelessness, worthlessness, loss of interest or pleasure in all normal activities, sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much (both), tiredness and lack of energy, reduced appetite, anxiety, agitation, restlessness, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame, trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things, and suicidal thoughts.

the above was simply a copy/paste of pretty much everything that embodies depression.

is this it?  really?  i'm not even functioning anymore.

fuck my life, seriously.  absolutely nothing seems to be okay.  i'm not okay."
1516,depression,Just a vent and a story,"First of all, sorry for the grammar, english it's not my main language.
I just wanted to say something bad that I've done, but i'm too afraid to tell anyone that i have a good relationship.
Two days ago I was suffering too much all day, but in the night I was totally breaking down, so I thought that drinking would solve my problem (I almost do not drink at all), and there you go, I have drunk some of it and it really worked, I was calm after all, then I got back to my bad and started watching some tv until like 3:00am, but at this time I started feeling so much angry about everything that was happening in my life, and I gone to the kitchen and started trying cutting myself(I already done that in the past, but I never done fully) and I just couldn't stop, it was like the right thing that I needed to do, for like, punishing myself, I don't know. 
And that's it, I'm now with a cut in my wrist, and more scared that at some point I will probably kill myself, I already tried therapy, and now I'm taking some pills, but nothing seems to work..."
1517,depression,Am i a bad person if a little bit jealous of my brother?,"My brother is very depressed right now, doesn't leave his room, doesn't eat, doesn't talk or answer to anyone. Don't get me wrong i very much try everyday to talk to him in hopes him gets better. The thing is that everyone is worry about him and wants to help him and want to get him medical help. Which i obviously suggested. What bothers me is that a few years ago my parents and my brother found out i SH. My dad never addressed  to me and never made sure I got better or anything. My brother and my mom both suggested, not at the same moment, that i was just copying my friends ans probably just did it because i wanted to be "" cool"". That day was the worst day of my life and I still cry everytime I remember that day. They never took it seriously and I never stopped cutting until 2 years ago, except from 2 relapse i had this year. Which obviously then don't know.  But still all the work i did all alone because no one who gave a shit about me. This past week I felt seriously sad because they show so much care and worry for my brother,  but they they not once made sure I was okay in these years. And I feel that from this moment I can't never say a thing because they will acuse me of wanting 'attention' again. I obviously hope the best for my brother and want him to get better. And i don't if now is the time for me to feel this jealous because how bad he is. Do you guys think that maybe they are right and i just want attention?"
1518,depression,"I just learned that unemployment is stopping my payments due to me working one single week at a job and then getting let go. I'm completely fucked now and this is the last straw for me, mentally. I think I'm finally ""done""","I had covid last year and ended up with permanent lung damage so I've been out of work for white a while trying to find something that isn't manual labor. 

I found a job in mid July that I thought fit the bill, but they ended up lying to me about the nature of the position and it turned out to be immense physical labor. My performance was poor so they let me go after 7 days. I went to certify for unemployment at midnight a little while ago like normal and it said that since there was a break in my certifications due to me working, they need me to resubmit everything all over again including the info from my new job. And it said it would take weeks to begin payments again.

I'm already skipping meals trying to save up for my upcoming move at the end of August (to a cheaper shittier place to try and save more money) but now that doesn't seem like it's possible. 


I'm just done, mentally. I can't handle it anymore. 15 months of agony, sacrifice, and overwhelming anxiety all the time about trying to just *survive* and now THIS happens? 

I have everything I need to planned out. I'll try calling the unemployment office on Monday as a last ditch effort to try and get this rectified but I am not optimistic about my chances. I know my fiancee would be better off without me holding her back with my poor health and bad luck. I just hope she isn't hurting for too terribly long and finds a way to move in swiftly."

It‚Äôs the fact that everyone I talk to, I just don‚Äôt feel anything anymore and/or they think the same about me. I‚Äôm not picky with who I talk to, it‚Äôs just impossible to meet someone who would stay through my goods and my bads. 

Right now, at this very moment, I have 1 friend who I talk to at least twice a week or so. We don‚Äôt really hang out, but we check on each other and feels genuine.

1521,depression,I don't know what to do...,"So I am an Indian 16M getting fucked by evrything in life, our education system is fucked

I am in 11th grade, my school fucks me, my coaching institute fucks me
And above all this my parents fuck me, they never support me for any of my decisions and never ever speak from my side (if somebody scolds me they too get in their side, not mine)

I sometimes feel like suicidal but the only thing holding me is, I think about my younger brother,

I just wanna become a 3d artist but they never support me, they think I should become engineer and fuck my life

The 2nd thing stopping me from sucide is that I sometimes get cheered up when I get to play online with my friends on Wednesday, for like 2 hrs becoz my parents go to doctor for checkup.

Once my father saw me playing with my friends, he snatched from me my phone and pc both for 1 week

The only motto of my father is, if I want to become successful in life I should study for 30 hrs in 1 day

My subjects for 11th grade are PCM(physics, chemistry and maths), I get the baddest grades in everything 

Was gonna fail in 10th grade, got passed due to Corona and exam cancelation (don't judge me by this please) 

And they all fuck me too,
I have had so many dreams, all crushed by my parents

And I can't even go to therapist cause my parents are so strict that I can't even go out of house aur talk to anybody after 4pm(and they don't even give pocket money, so I am poor too, my parents aren't ) 

Cant even leave and run away cause I have no where to go


I don't know what to do

All I wanna do is just get relaxed and do whatever, whenever I want


And the biggest fuck that happen today is that, I have a ptm (parent teacher meet) today at 1pm but I accidentally lost the zoom credentials for meeting and now the coaching institute isn't picking up my calls

Everyone hates me, it's just they don't tell me about this

And these motherfucking coaching institute give a test every fucking Sunday, I got one nest sunday on 8th August, I am gonna study till 8yh and decide about my life at same time

Thanks for reading this large piece of my shitty life, very much appreciate you

And this is only a part of my feelings, if I made a post about my whole life it would be larger then 2 harry potter books combined together"
1522,depression,15 Inspiring Quotes to Help You Grow Emotionally,[removed]
1523,depression,"Depression in the form of an ""auto-voice""","I have struggled with severe depression and anxiety since I was 9 years old. Only in the last two years have I addressed it with a combination of medication, therapy, and sobriety from alcohol. I'm 39, married, father of three.

2 years ago I hit rock bottom. Fell into the abyss and almost didn't climb out. I thought I had suppressed the auto-voice that is in my head telling me how horrible and worthless I am, after climbing out of the hole. But recently the voice has returned.

Does anyone else have this voice? I try reframing but it's not working anymore.

I feel myself descending again.

Its excruciatingly lonely. Maddening. I just want to hear some voices other than the auto-voice."

1526,depression,Depression from illness must be the worst depression,"I suffer from mild depression, but I have my dark days and today was one of them. Except today I woke up ill and incredibly dizzy. The room was spinning and I couldn‚Äôt sleep it away. I had to stay awake. Made me think. Depression caused by illness must be the worst type of depression. I can handle depression from heartbreak, possibly even bereavement even though it would be hard. But to be depressed and ill I am certain I would look to end my life and that upsets me.

I thought I was stronger than that."

1531,depression,My life is ::good:: but I'm depressed as fuck - sometimes people call me negative and I think it's really unfair. I wouldn't choose to be miserable all the time.,"I just find everything to be so empty - and I am too apathetic and depressed even to do the things I used to love.

I'm not looking for pity or trying to play the victim, I take accountability for my own life.

But I barely have the energy to get through the day most days. It sucks and I feel so sorry for my husband.

I can't find the joy and beauty in the simple things anymore, I used to love looking at trees and flowers and just be in awe - not everything just looks blah - I feel everything is in a haze.

I just feel like life is meaningless and there is no reason to continue.

There is nothing :wrong: in my life, and I don't have a :reason: to be depressed - but I just am.

People tell me just live in gratitude and be grateful and in truth I am, I know we are lucky to have a home, and jobs, and food, and vehicles.

People always say ""at least you have your health"" - but. The truth is I don't. Depression makes everyday feel like an absolute struggle and I just can't wait to be home in bed (of course I'm lucky to have a bed)

I just don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.

I'm actually starting to think about seeing an endocrinologist because I'm wondering if it's depression or maybe something else, like hormones, thyroid, or adrenal fatigue or something."

1539,depression,I just want to rant for a bit about my life.,"So I got a new job early June because my old workplace was getting really toxic even though I loved it but I just knew it was time for me to go for certain reasons I won't get into. This new job i got is kind of similar to Trader Joe's, and I thought it was a start of a new journey and it's a fresh breath of air. I get paid a lot more, I am given a lot more hours, and there are bonuses that come with the job as well. 
 The excitement didn't really last long. I'm not treated very well there. I try to do my best and excellency with everything but a few coworkers of mine including a manager start to belittle me and treat me like I'm dumb and like I'm a five year old. 
They aren't nice at all. It's not like I am rude or treat them negatively, I actually go to work with my very best and I try to be nice and kind to everyone. When I ask questions, I have been told that ""I need to think"" and ""that I need to use my brain"" and that ""I'm clearly not trained properly"" when there's something I don't understand. And when I try to reach to manager about it I'm told that those people that said those to me are just like that and I need to not let it get to me. 
But it is getting to me. I'm just more than a month in and I've cried so much at work, and dreaded going in, and overall this workplace has made me go back to a really bad depressive episode. I'm in a position too where I can't leave yet and I have to suck it up and wait, so right now there's nothing I can really do but hold on tight and tell myself that this will only be temporary. But it's getting seriously hard to go on. I want to move out but I can't yet. I feel really trapped and I can't breath. It seems like I'm the only employee too that gets treated like this. 
 That's all for my rant. Thank you for listening."
1540,depression,I just want everything to be over,"I'm a 20 year old guy, I've been dealing with depression for a couple years now, but as of the last few months it's just gotten worse and worse. I'm too tired to go into the full story, but in short, I dropped out of school, lost 2 jobs, my parents have given up on me and think I'm useless, and my girlfriend of 1 year recently left me, which still hurts the most out of everything.


I've been talking to therapists and taking medication, but nothing helps. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I can't distract myself with anything to make me happy. Things I used to love, video games, music, now it's just nothing. 

I'm just so overwhelmed right now by everything. I have barely gotten out of bed in the last month. Out of all the problems and shit I have going on, the most I can think of is my now ex-girlfriend. I miss her so much and it's killing me.

I used to think I could be something different in life, but now I'm just ready for it to be over. The reasons to hold on are slowly fading away. I don't want to kill myself, I just want everything to be over with. I forgot what it's like to go to bed and wake up happy."

I do good on studying for a week or two and then it goes down the drain and I lose my track and I have to start over. I‚Äôm swimming in debt from student loans, and when I‚Äôm home I‚Äôm either getting shamed for not spending every minute studying (when I don‚Äôt even think I can do quality studying in my room) or being pressured to care for my family and provide hot meals daily since I‚Äôm so available as I‚Äôm also not working. One minute it‚Äôs when r u going to take ur test, and the next it‚Äôs good thing you‚Äôre not working bc ur granny needs you (in the months since ive graduate she‚Äôs had a pace maker removed and then went back in after recovering for a hip replacement). at one point I questioned if god was delaying my progress for a year so I could help everyone else, but not truly help myself.

the icing on the cake was maybe being in splitsville after arguing w my emotionally abusive bf today and on the drive home my car started shaking and flashing engine lights. so now i have that burden to add to my never ending list of emotional and then also very very real problems. I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll be on bad terms for too long as my bday is Tuesday, but I‚Äôm also kind of dreading that day bc my family will want to go out to eat to be nice to me and money is so tight. I told myself if I ever ran into good money and could work and be stable, I would make a promise w god that I would be the one to pay for my bday dinner and host it myself so no one has to worry and I would bear that for everyone so they can at least get some kind of joy out of coming out to celebrate me. but what‚Äôs there to even celebrate about me, no one is proud of me as I‚Äôm a year delayed in my career, but I guess they like me as a person since we‚Äôre all family.

honestly, i don‚Äôt even think i was meant to live long. part of me has always thought i had too many problems to live for much longer. I wonder if I‚Äôll be able to live one day and not have a dark cloud over me.

i thought maybe I could get a part time and save to kind of uplift myself, maybe I could get my studying in tack but it‚Äôs been a year and I‚Äôm deep in the hole i dug for myself. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll get around now and I don‚Äôt want to be a burden on anyone.

how can I pick myself up from this"
1549,depression,Life is fucking dumb,I seriously don't get the point of it and its getting old fast. Fuck this noise. Im so fucking over it.
1550,depression,Suicidal,It‚Äôs so close to my moms anniversary of 3 years in November and I‚Äôve been feeling like I have nobody anymore I‚Äôm so young at 24 I‚Äôm having my suicidal thoughts all over again which I haven‚Äôt had in 3 years but for some reason it hit me the worst this year .. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore ‚Ä¶üíîüò£
1551,depression,It isn't worth fighting it,"So for some context. I'm a trans woman (19) and I can be ok ish passable. Most the time I can pass fine. But off I have dysphoria, I've been molested a lot as a kid, physically abused, almost raped, ect ect. While I have a great family. I deal heavily with bi polar, and depression mixed with ADHD. Sometimes I feel like things are on top of the world and that I can do anything. But them... A lot or most the times I get like this. Where my emotional downs are so deep that my chest physical hurts. That I can go even months without showering (covid and stuck at home so it's easy to forget). Or even just feed myself good food. I've been stuck here in a place where there's nothing but proud boys and other far right groups who would love to get the chance to hurt me. I was supposed to be in cali last year but covid happened. I'm going there in the fall but tbh. Knowing I'll live life like this? It's not worth it. I hate that everyday it feels as if I'm hanging on to this piece of wood drifting in the middle of an ocean. And sometimes storms come and try to drown me. It's a constant state of fighting to just survive. I mean when it gets to the point where you wanting to pee is considered a political statement. And that people want to call you a pedophile for just wanting to pee ... What's the point? I mean I'm always going to fight for my life so why even try? My chest hurts so much it legit feels as if my heart is gone and I feel such a deep pain I can't do anything. I want to end it all but for some reason my instinctual need to live is preventing me. But I can't stop thinking about how nice it would be to just end it all. I have no friends irl. I'm my current situation I'm forced to wait to move before I can make friends irl. With all this past traumatic experiences and ptsd I choose terrible friends who further contribute to my depression. I have no love for myself. I fall in love with anyone. It's so bad I miss the fact when I was a kid at least older men would want my attention. Nothing is worth it anymore. I have pages and pages of suicide notes because it helps the pain but I have a full notebooks worth already. I can't do this. Why should I do this? Because some select group of people will miss me? Because my dog will be heart broken? Idk if that's enough anymore. I'll never be a ""woman"" in my eyes. And even with a bit over a decade of therapy my ptsd isn't gone. My trauma still heavily affects me. Idk what to do. I want to fix it but genuinely I've done everything. I want love anything. I want to do anything other then what I am now. I dream of waking up as a cis woman. I've begged and begged whatever and whoever might listen (I'm an atheist but at this point I'll beg any god or gods at night just so I can cry). To just be given the opportunity to be a woman. I just want a restart. My life was doomed from the start. I have so much hate for this world. And while I'm a huge humanitarian and could never be pushed to a mass shooter level. I just have the hate that makes my entire body shake. That in my mind I can't wait for all these fucks to die. But then I realize that they'll always be terrible people and I'll always be the freak. I won't ever have redemption. They'll never be justice or even revenge. I'll never be equal to anyone. I'm only writing this here because I broke my only pencil writing my last note which is fucking 4 pages long. This is a cry for help. Which ultimately won't mean shit. Because it's not like some internet strangers can genuinely offer any advice on how to magically fix all my issues so I can finally try a normal life. But at least I can cry it out here so I can finally get so tired I pass out. Then rinse and repeat for a month or however my depression last."
1552,depression,I feel like I‚Äôm faking it,"I always feel like I‚Äôm faking it and doing it for attention
Like I talk to a friend about my problems, or post about it and I feel like I‚Äôm faking it because my brain says ‚Äúoh tell them this and blah blah you‚Äôll get actually attention for once‚Äù or something, or sometimes I am still happy about stuff or enjoy things or I feel like nothings fun anymore and that‚Äôs probably just me being Lazy.
I don‚Äôt have it as bad as other people so I just feel like I‚Äôm faking it all the time because why else would I be sad about everything going on? It‚Äôs hard to describe but it just feels like everything i‚Äôm doing is for attention and I don‚Äôt know what to do about it.
Everyone says that if I‚Äôm worried about this I‚Äôm probably not a attention whore, or maybe I do want attention but in a ‚ÄúI need help please‚Äù way but I don‚Äôt know that doesn‚Äôt makes me feel better.
I‚Äôm really sorry if this is a dumb post."

1557,depression,Does therapy actually help?,"Does therapy actually help. What is paying someone to pretend to be a crappy friend going to do? From what I've heard they barely give advice and just simply listen to you. I can listen to myself for free, so why pay for a therapist? I know how to self analyze, so why do I need them?"
1558,depression,I can't wait to kill myself,"Just cycles of feeling ""Alright"" then back in the hole of overwhelming urges to totally destroy myself. How long should anyone put up with this? I just lost money which was a bulk of my savings, gone. Why don't i just smash my head into the wall? I'm dying more and more everyday. I just want to get addicted to heroin and OD on the best stuff on earth (allegedly)."

1560,depression,My piece of advice if you feel lonely at times,"If you're far away from home, in an unknown place without any friend. Embrace loneliness ! 

I used to be lonely af when I was in college. I'm gonna be lonely next year because I move to a city far away from home where I don't have any acquaintance. 

My piece of advice : be independant. Of course it's easier if you have a car, a job and a good salary. But just embrace loneliness. You're on your own in a place where you don't know everyone ? All you can see around you are crowded bars with laughing gangs of friends. So what ? Take your coat, walk in the streets of your city, go to the swimming pool, to the cinema. Take your car or the train. Go away. If you're blue, alone in your flat on a sunday evening, well take your car / train and go to the nearest big city/seaside resort/... 

You're independant. Lions are walking alone. You're free. Just enjoy this freedom. You don't need any friend to do so."
1561,depression,Suicidal but no immediate danger,"I'm suicidal, but I'm not the usual suicidal person. 
I wish to die. 
But I don't feel the need to die. 
If anything, death isn't what I truly want. 
What I want is to end everything. 
Doesn't have to be death. 
If I could, I want to forget everything, including who I am. 
Though if im still stuck with the same toxic family and living in the same toxic environment, then I guess forgetting wont solve anything. 
If possible, I want to erase myself, my existence as a whole. 
If I never existed, then everything wouldn't matter anymore. 
I'm suicidal, but I don't have a definite plan to kill myself. 
Im just always thinking about death, thinking that I'd be better off dead, and thinking that I'm so tired that I just wish everything would end. 
I'm suicidal, but I'm not the proactive type. 
Im the passive type.
I have a tendency to neglect myself and be reckless. 
There have been times when I was driving and for a moment, I let off the gas. 
There were times when I was not feeling well and needed to take meds, knowing fair well the correct amount to take, I would recklessly take more for stronger affects without a care for the possible consequences.
There were also times in which I was legitimately dying due to a severe allergy attack and was reluctant to call for help or go to the hospital, in the end, I was in ICU for a couple 12 hours and hospitalized for 4 days. 
You're probably wonder whats going on in my head. 
My thoughts are simple.
I simply thought: 
""In the worst case scenario, I will die. But since death is actually a desirable outcome, so why bother?"" 
But I do have thoughts, thoughts of committing suicide in the far future when I'm living on my own, away from my family. I have thoughts of just one day, without leaving a letter or anything, not crying or devastated, simply because I felt like it, I would kill myself. 
Im only living because I'm being pushed to.
But life is so tiring. 
Everything, even breathing requires effort. 
So my point is: 
Even though I'm suicidal, I don't plan to kill myself any time soon, but I also don't expect myself to live till old age. I most definitely won't last that long. Who knows, but living up till age 30 doesn't sound bad. I've still got 9 more years, a bit long if I may say. I wonder if I'll live up to 30?"
1562,depression,A facade,"23 and nothing more than a husk of a human. How do you explain to someone the only reason you haven‚Äôt killed your self is so that your family can live the lie that is your life. A facade put on for the ones you ‚Äúcare‚Äù for so they can enjoy the empty shell that you‚Äôve become. A smile created for others peace of mind but more false than a carnival mirror. The yearning for the sweet release from this torment that I endure for others everyday. I‚Äôm growing tired, I feel like I‚Äôve lived for 10 lifetimes. The days pass and the world grows grey and cold."

1564,depression,Do you feel a lottery win would help you out of your depression?,"It's all I dream about.  I'm mostly depressed because a lack of money has me stuck, and I cant make money because all of my problems are preventing me from doing so.  Money would buy me a car, driving lessons,  some needed dental work, foot surgery, fix the physical things I am insecure about, therapy, help for my vision problems, migraine treatments, the ability to move away, a house that is not falling apart with a damp and mould problem, a properly functioning toilet, a cooker.  I feel it would put me in a happier place, and I could make friends, have a partner, a family. 

Anyone feel the same, or do you feel it would make your life worse?"
1565,depression,I don‚Äôt know if I can love,"I 19 yr (f) joined a dating app to see if I could finally find someone I like, and I met a really nice guy and we‚Äôve been talking for the past week.

I‚Äôve tried to have a relationship one time before and I broke it off quickly cause I felt the  same as I do now. He flirts and idk what to say back, I thought this is what I wanted but I just wanna cry because I can‚Äôt feel anything towards him. I barely feel anything at all most of the time. I wanna tell him this before he tries to get into a relationship with me but I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôve dragged this out. I know it‚Äôs been a week and he lives somewhere else so it‚Äôs not a huge deal but he‚Äôs super nice and I don‚Äôt wanna upset him. I feel like I can‚Äôt love anyone. It‚Äôs already hard with my friends and family because I feel so emotional gone. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore I feel stuck and like my life is gonna stay this way. If anyone has any advice please comment."
1566,depression,I want to wake up with terminal cancer because I'm tired of my fucking life,"I have no excitement in my fucking life, I have no friends, lost my job, people keep lying to me, every hobby I try to be interested in, life fucks it for me. Oh I went to the gym and I stayed consistent at it? Going everyday? That was my only happiness, well guess what motherfucker, closed because of covid. Oh I enjoyed someone's company and I like them? Well, they leave me and never talk to me again. You started a course on something you love doing and you plan to make a career out of it? The teacher literally scams us by not showing up to class for months now and the school does nothing about it.

Why is it like this for me? It's like god wants me to fucking rot in my house all day, my summers are awful, I spend them all at home, my family doesn't go on vacations and even if they did, I wouldn't go with them, they are more depressing than I am, I don't want to be negative and complain all the time, that's why I enjoyed the gym so much, it made me so happy and gave me something to do but now it's gone.

I don't want to study or workout at home, I honestly spent most of my fucking life in my room, I have no social life, I've worked before and I actually lost my job because I got covid. 

My problem isn't money, my problem is that I'm so lonely all the time and I feel really unlucky guys, I don't know when I'm gonna meet a person that wants to be my friend in real life for real, that has to be first, let alone wanting someone who would want to date me but I am so used to getting rejected, no one really being interested in me both in friendships or relationship, I am so used to having a crush on a girl and her not liking me back at all, not even wanting to be friends with me, every person I like as a friend never wants to be my fucking friend.

And fuck that, before you say I'm negative, I'm so cheery all the time, I laugh, I smile so much when I'm outside with people, I invite them to do things, eat new food, do activities, I propose things to do but I get a no all the time, I just want to be given a chance that's all really

And to be honest with you folks, the only person I am negative to is myself, I tell myself bad things, my head is literally a bad neighborhood but I am the best version of myself IRL with people but yet they never want to hang out with me, I bought a camera, I am so interested in photography and yet I couldn't find a single person to help me practice portraits or just hang out with me while I take pictures.

God, the only thing I need is a bullet, a gun and I'll end my fucking life, no hesitation."
1567,depression,Tryna get my life back on track,"These past 2 years have been some of the hardest years of my life. Dealing with severe acne destroyed my life. Even after a year of dealing with the painful mental and physical side affects of acne I was left with these hideous scars. Through it all I secluded myself, abandoned relationships, and gave up on my sports career. Everyday I laid on my bed wishing I was dead. I felt as if my life had no direction and meaning. I lost everything. I felt like i could never be loved or have anyone understand my pain. My mind tormented me like a demon. If I didn‚Äôt try to make a change I would have put a bullet in my skull. Enough was enough this past month I made a change. i repaired a series of broken friendships and am trying to get back into sports.

1568,depression,An I depressed?,"Hey. I am a 21 year old who battles OCD and Anxiety. I tend to always think I have a physical or mental health problem due to my health anxiety. However, I wondered if maybe this is different. I am a strong guy. Although I battle OCD (perfectionism OCD) and anxiety, I always enjoy going out with my friends (even if it is harder nowdays due to anxiety), and I never have a hopeless outlook on life. I may get stressed but I always pick myself up and lift my spirits when I do. I smile in the day and enjoy things such as football, meditation and seeing my friends. These are my passions. I must say I do find it hard to do stuff as much now, as the idea of soing it perfectly and the anxiety that goes with it can lead to hours of procrastination. But I understand thats normal. However it is this inability to do stuff I used to that makes me scared. As I understand anohedia or whatever is a symptom. However, I must state - I am still passionate about these things. Just may find it harder to sit down and work. My personal hygeine and sleep is relatively normal, as I do not ever sleep way too much or none at all. My brain‚Äôs high cortisol can wake me up early hours sometimes - but I can always just get back to sleep and get rougly normal hours in (usually between 6-8 hours a night). I must say I am never hopeless on life - always hopefull I can recover from OCD and anxiety. Please let me know what u think !"

I've been off my fluoxetine for a couple months. I was fine for a while but then I started getting irritable. Now feeling more hopeless. Thankfully my suicidal ideation hasn't returned, but I fear it might. I used to constantly think about ways to kill myself or have a voice telling me to do it. I don't want them to come back. Trying to calm down. I hate being like this. I just want to be level-headed again. I feel like I'm losing myself."
1571,depression,Oh well,I‚Äôm pretty sure I just had some kind of mental breakdown or psychotic break or something. Idk. That was...really scary. I feel tired. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm fully out of it yet. I genuinely can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôve done this before. It doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve had this particular feeling but there have been times where I‚Äôve been this upset. It feels like I‚Äôm crazy. Like I can‚Äôt trust anything I think or feel. Like nothing I thought I knew is real. I wonder if I have some sort of delusional disorder. I had to look it up but I didn‚Äôt come to any kind of conclusion. I have no idea.

1572,depression,Not sure what is wrong but I hate this,"It's another one of those chainsmoking kind of nights lads and lasses and everything outside in between.

I wake up I go to work I eat a meal a day sometimes and then I just sit there awake it's 4:30 in the morning right now there's nothing there there's nothing left I no longer have anything to keep me going. I used to just play games or hang out with my friends but they've all either gone or I'm just not happy with them I don't want to bring them down with my bad mood. I stopped drinking because I'm self-aware enough to realize that that's only putting more poisons into my body that are going to kill me but honestly what's the harm in that even if it only makes me feel good for a temporary bit of time it's something I wouldn't even say feel Good Just feel something. I don't know what's wrong. This has actually been happening for years now nothing fixes it and the thought of living the rest of my life like this is horrifying I dread it. What does Reddit think, and don't give me some bullshit about everything gets better you just got to live with yourself. Just give me a straight answer does it really get better or is that something we just tell ourselves?"
1573,depression,Hey,"Not sure where to start but here‚Äôs another one of those posts. 

I think I‚Äôm broken 

I‚Äôm depressed&amp;anxious

I‚Äôm so frustrated and caught up all the time 

and I‚Äôm sad?
Passed few months I‚Äôve barely been feeling sadness. I just feel emotionless. Lost I guess 

Im not sure what to say but tonight I just feel broken 

My childhood was broken 
My young teens were self breaking because of my mind
My young adulthood is terrifying(as for everyone) and just so static 

Tonight I feel broken and I think it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve felt this words meaning 

As I mentioned this. I don‚Äôt know how to explain my emotions these passed couple months. Just emotionless and numb in a way I guess 

Yeah forsure I have a great time in situations and I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm happy in those moment fooooorrrrsure . But deeply, I think I‚Äôm broken . Probably maybe perhaps 

I don‚Äôt know myself and wish I did , I‚Äôm lost

I know I don‚Äôt have to say this cause there‚Äôs no reason but something in me just wants to say I‚Äôm sorry, so I am, I‚Äôm sorry , and I wish I wasn‚Äôt 

It‚Äôs so hard for me to put things in place because my mind builds walls around stresses and it‚Äôs so weird, I don‚Äôt understand  

I know I‚Äôm a nice guy, and don‚Äôt do anything wrong hopefully but I really do feel like a horrible person 

I hat this and by the end of this text, there‚Äôs a shimmer of felling defeat within my brain 
Aren‚Äôt brains so weird? 

I hope your well as you can be today and tomorrow and never set feet off this earth until 95 

Peace , much love"
1574,depression,Lonely.,"Hanging out with you doesn't have to be a big event, we don't have to plan anything or make a whole day free for it, even though that's fun...

I just want to sit with you and talk about nothing, but I don't know how to ask you if we can do that without it sounding weird. I'm just trying too hard I guess, I love you too much. I'm sorry. At least you have other people with more independent lives and better social skills than mine in your life, I can't get the stupid thought out of my head that you probably have way more fun hanging out with them than with me.

1577,depression,"how do you come to terms with the fact that you're going to be like this for the rest of your life, and that the majority of your peers will never go through that?","disclaimer that i know i should be optimistic and that having such a shitty mindset like the title implies is Not Good, but i feel like i deserve to want to know the answer to that question and to think abt it because i am probably going to be like this for the rest of my life, unless a switch suddenly flips the moment i set foot on a university campus (am focused on passing the exams necessary to even get to that point rn üëçüëç)

i feel like the title is pretty self explanatory. it's been hitting me a lot recently (thanks to uni talk and the fact that exams are too close and soon and upcoming etc etc) that i've kind of just been progressing at an inanely slow ""stop being crippled by depression go to your classes wake up in the morning now"" rate. i know that progress is progress and that i've made an insane amount of it these past five years.

i'm proud of myself for that, and grateful to myself for sticking it out for so long and so far. but it's really hard to remember that, and it feels pathetic to think things like ""i wake up in the morning and can get out of bed before 8. i eat 3 meals a day at normal times. i force myself to not self-isolate during classtime because ik it'll make me feel worse. i did seek psychiatric help i just currently have no time outside of class for it"" when your peers are literally international gymnastic champions, national winners and other miscellaneous achievements.

while i'm aware that my school pushes their students to be the best and that's the reason why it feels like every week i hear about another dozen achievements done in the name of this school, and that the majority of people are not insanely talented, they're just people who are doing averagely well and excelling in stuff they're good at and have an interest in. 

but i still resent that. not all the times, i've just recently kept on getting stuck on the incredibly self absorbed thought (self awareness lmao) that it's so fucking unfair to me that that i have to live life like this. that i have to embody depression to the point where even the most ""depression isn't real lmao"" person has to go ""yeah you have serious issues and they obstruct and affect your life everyday, on a daily recurring basis"" (before going ""but also you still go to your classes and wake up in the morning so no lol depression isn't real), while the majority of my peers won't. 

i don't want my peers to suffer or have to feel like shit everyday, or for my whole year level to have trouble focusing in 90% of their classes. i just feel so angry and upset that i have to be like this, that i can't be better. that i've lived like this and that i'm going to keep on living like this. like some stupid disadvantage that i have to push against everyday just to wake up, just to do things, and even then i fail. i procrastinate on assignments, i cry because it's really fucking hard sometimes, and then i put in herculean efforts to get the work down in time. it just feels so unbearably unfair sometimes."

I grew up around violence, sexual assault and emotional abuse/ manipulation. It‚Äôs still hard to figure things out, even with medication, therapy and self-journaling.

1583,depression,I want to get better. Some nice words maybe?,"Might be a long post. I'm living hoping this is only just an episode. Maybe the hope is what keeps me going?

&amp;#x200B;

This year became the worst one in my life. tl;dr, my (now) ex boyfriend lost feelings towards me and broke up with me, found new girlfriend few weeks after. Now I have to move out to a new place (we share house) because he can't handle me being upset and it's a bit awkward. 

I'm moving out next week and it's very scary for me. 

I used to be happy. Of course I had my problems and such but I considered myself a happy, cute, bubbly person with passions. Now I feel like an empty shell of a human. 

This whole situation made me very depressed and miserable. Anxiety is killing me and I spend most of my days in bed. I got antidepressants, therapy, been calling helplines but it feels like I'm not making much progress. I felt bad to the point where I self harmed for the first time in my life. I felt like I wasn't myself and was very scared after I realised what I've done, ended up at A&amp;E day after. I've been having a bit of suicidal thoughts too.

I wish I could have dealt with this situation better. I'm so worried about myself :("

Want friends, want to be invited places. Have nothing. 
Trying to escape the toxic people and they just make more abusive comments.

I don't want him to know I'm scared, because then he'll be worried of ever leaving me. 

We both want to go our separate ways, to find our purpose in life. But he told me he was scared to, because he was scared *for me*. 

and it makes me feel like shit, BECAUSE HE'S RIGHT TO BE WORRIED ABOUT ME.   
I have never wanted to live for as long as I have. I seriously have never seen my graduation until the day it happened. NOw I worry that I'll never see success until the day it happens. WHich sounds pretty fuckin miserable to me. 

Recently, a sudden upbringing of urges have emerged. 

it. has. been. KILLING. ME. 

All I'm thinking about right now are the chances I have at acquiring a good blade to use on my skin. It's all I've thought about for weeks now, and I use marijuana wax to numb the urges away.   


Okay, I'm finished with my rant. 

All realness, I'm really looking forward to being alone. Now that I'm an adult, I have many possibilities(after I require my important documents). Most of the things I'm looking forward to, are the many opportunities I'll get at making some new friends, on my own. 

With my new levels of self-things(esteem, worth, confidence, etc.), I'm feeling sure that I'll have a better perspective when out in society. I feel like a butterfly emerging from a cocoon. 

I'm still a little scared of what is about to come. The fact that there are too many possibilities, keeps me on my tippy toes.

I used to be the popular girl in high school and thought i made a lot of friends in college, but now I don‚Äôt really have many close friends at all, and also no real way of reaching out and making friends because there‚Äôs nothing significant in who I am that I could leverage in fostering friendships. I don‚Äôt have any hobbies or interests I enjoy enough, and the only part of my personality that‚Äôs consistent is that I‚Äôm depressed and overly sensitive. When it comes to interacting with others, I often feel as if I mold my identity to fit theirs, but it‚Äôs not really something that‚Äôs ‚Äúmine‚Äù. I can‚Äôt list fun facts about myself, because there‚Äôs nothing there. I don‚Äôt have goals or a vision. I struggle to describe who I am as a person, because I don‚Äôt know who i really am, and feel as if there‚Äôs nothing significant that makes up me / my identity the way it is for others. It‚Äôs been this way for awhile now, so I don‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs my depression or if the person i am is just someone who isn‚Äôt really anyone at all... Has anyone else ever felt this way?"

Worst of all, I‚Äôve watched so many people die unnecessarily. People close to me. Casual acquaintances. Friends of friends.

The antidote? Brain cells. Just a small amount of brain cells. You don‚Äôt need a lot. Yet, apparently, too many humans don‚Äôt have enough. 

If we were all doing our best, that would be one thing. But to have approximately a third of all people consciously thwarting the most common sense measures to keep us safe? It‚Äôs maddening.

There has to be a reason for that which is probably that I'm just a fucking waste of space. They're like ""If you won't go then I won't go either"" and I feel like I'm just ruining their fun. I just want them to be happy. I can't handle suddenly being an amazing guy. It just makes me confused and anxious. I would love to spend time with them but I feel like I'm just a burden for them. They don't need me in their lives they'll find someone else. I'm just so used to being the guy in the background that nobody notices or if they do notice they usually just think I'm a big fucking retard. Which is probably true.

Broken

I despise reality

Its all I can see

Most people dream

Or have dreams

I just see reality

I can see my wife

I can see my kids

I cannot see my happiness

I cannot burden them with my disability

I will not see my wife

I will not see my kids

They do not exist

They will not exist

I will not let them exist

One day that might be close or far

The sadness of the world will complete its ritual on my being

It is inevitable 

This is reality

They say if you commit fully you will attain your dreams

I agree

But I will never do that

I find sadness wherever I look

I feel alone all the time

I see imperfections in every aspect of my being

I know fully that I could attain my dreams

But I know I won‚Äôt commit

I see reality

I despise reality"

1616,depression,I couldn't even kill myself properly..,"I got scared. I got scared of all the things I would be missing out. There's still so much I wanted to do, all my life I've tried so hard to do something with my life. No matter how hard I try, it's never enough, I can't even hold the fruits of my labour and appreciate its beauty. How many more times will I be given a glimpse of everything I desire, everything I possibly can't have, a glimmer of how better life could be, and then snatched away before I can get close. I see all the opportunities I can never have, the person I can never be, because of the country I'm born in and the colour of my skin. I'm tired, so tired. I'm at a point way beyond my limit, how many more breakdowns, how many more broken pieces, how many more scars, how many more panic attacks, how much longer should I stare at the void. My whole life has been this way ever since I can remember. I can't go on much longer... But apparently even in my last moments, I fail to do it right, I let myself get help and get admitted in the hospital to pump out all the drugs. Why did I still hope that life could be better when I've only known otherwise?

It's bad enough that my mind betrayed me (whichever choice you choose to be the betrayal feel free to decide), I have to constantly answer everyone's questions of why and listen to their judgements, scoldings and condemnation. I even have to explain to the police why I did it. I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID IT, MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO LIVE ANYMORE, IF I KNEW EXACTLY WHY I CAN'T FIND THE STRENGTH TO LIVE, THEN I WOULDN'T BE HERE LISTENING TO YOUR BS!!! 
These people hardly know me or my life and my experiences, what gives them the right to condemn me. One of the nurses who was doing the procedure on me, said that he would beat me, yes BEAT ME, if I tried to do it again!!! I don't need anyone's sympathy but for goodness sake please be a bit more understanding and shut it with your questions, what good does it do for you knowing why I took this decision, a good source of gossip maybe? I already see you looking at me, pointing at me and whispering. I'm still stuck at the hospital, but all I do is, want to go home. They won't let me go home, it's been more than a day, they said I had to stay overnight for observation, physically I'm all good, they won't even tell me anything with all this poking and prodding, please just let me go home, don't torture me further than my mind already does."

I posted on snapchat about being in the hospital, I don‚Äôt exactly know why I did‚Äî I set up myself for humiliation cuz now I‚Äôm now dubbed ‚Äúthe girl who tried to kill herself.‚Äù It pisses me the fuck off because I didn‚Äôt even tell anyone about kms, they just assume so bc they know Im depressed.

Whenever people ask abt it (which is rare) I just blame my doctor. 

Why is it that we must push people over the edge to care? 

People, or the people that I know, don‚Äôt care about attempts, only the suicides."
1618,depression,"[Progress]It‚Äôs taken a long time, but I‚Äôm finally starting to like the person I am.","I‚Äôve been depressed since the age of 11. Admitted to multiple mental hospitals, several therapists, 2 wilderness therapy trips, and almost a decade wasted on RuneScape. Around 6 months ago I decided I wanted to stop spending all my time on a game and actually live my life. 

Quitting video games was the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done. I lost my community, my purpose in life, my self worth, and a huge part of my identity. Over the following weeks I‚Äôd develop severe anxiety, body dysmorphia, and a dangerously high blood pressure. I‚Äôd spend days without moving at all, with my brain on a constant loop thinking about what a piece of shit human being I was. 

Despite how much easier my life was while playing video games, I didn‚Äôt want to give up and return to where I was, so I kept pushing myself. My biggest hurdle was having absolutely no confidence in myself or my social ability. People would try to start conversations with me, and I lived in constant fear of disappointing them or wasting their time. This led to some really painful social interactions that would make me want to give up and hide, like I should accept that I‚Äôll just be alone forever. 

Eventually I realized that it doesn‚Äôt make sense to give other people that much control over my happiness. I set a goal for my life that I‚Äôm confident I can achieve, to give me something to think about other than my loneliness. I got a job, started going to the gym regularly, and I‚Äôve used my free time to develop my programming skills. Knowing that I‚Äôm working towards a goal does 2 things: it helps you feel good about the work you put in each day, and it allows you to care less about other people‚Äôs opinions. Since developing this mindset I‚Äôve had so much more fun talking to people! Sure, I say awkward shit almost constantly because I have aspergers and my processing speed isn‚Äôt the fastest, but I don‚Äôt let it get me down. When people can tell you‚Äôre enjoying a conversation, they‚Äôll try to talk to you more regardless of whatever awkward shit you say. 

It‚Äôs been a horrible, horrible journey but I genuinely like the person I am now. I see my good qualities more clearly than my negative ones. I wake up most mornings excited for what I get to do that day. 

Good luck for everyone battling with depression, unless you‚Äôve been through it it‚Äôs really hard to understand just how terrible depression is. The most important thing I‚Äôve learned is you can never give up. You‚Äôll have days that go so poorly you just want to put a bullet in your head and end all this bullshit. The hardest thing to do is to push past those feelings, understand tomorrow is a new day with new possibilities. And usually, the next day won‚Äôt be as bad (it might even be a good day!) individual days won‚Äôt be as bad if you can just focus on the progress you‚Äôve made."

I am 20 years old, never been in any kind of relationship. Now, I am nearly at the brink of no return. Whenever I am alone, I go just a little more crazy in my mind. I hate the fact that I am still alive because I view it as a punishment for both me and people around me. I think of myself as a leech for both my family and friends, and I can‚Äôt truly talk to anyone around me about my problems.

1625,depression,I cant get over the past I wish I could just fucking stop ruminating,"I know this is sloppy but bare with me:

 I'm 14M and the past year 2020 for me especially april/may-february has been a clusterfuck and the worst part is after the whole thing not while it was happening. Ever since february (when I started severly ruminating about the year before)  all I could think of the whole day was what I haven't done last year and how much better everything would be if  last year I did what I fucking want to now. I'm not going to be publics about it, but last year I had one interest I would spend all day on. I was somewhat depressed because I had a lot of fights with my parents april and one involved the cops getting called and they came to my house, starting saying I need to change and be fixed (I didnt want to )and  I think that basically changed most of my life. After that my main interest it took over my life after that I didn't talk to my parents and I spent all the time in my room. It was covid as you probablyt know so I couldnt do anything. All the time I spent was alone in my room. But that's just some background info. Now the main thing is my rumination of what I could've done in May-august 2020 aka when it was before 8th grade school but I had all free time. The thing I liked then  was all I spent my time on. I'm just going to say it it was hip hop/rap music, thats all I cared about then but the thing is all I did was fucking argue about it on the youtube comments and dumb ass shit like that. Then in september school started and I stated to want to have more interests and passions but then for some reason I didnt I guess and stuck with it. I barely remember anything from september-december 2020 even though I remember stuff a whole year and more before that perfectly. In february I started being more interested in another interest/passion/hobby film/tv and then other types of music. Which is 2 hobbies a much wider variety. I also just wished I would had other interests hobbies. From feb-now that's all I could think of, how I wish my interests/hobbies were different when I had the time. There are moments, usually spanning a few days, where I think forward and more positive. But 98 percent of the time from feb-now all I can think of is how I wish I just went back to may or so 2020. I just fucking hate that I can never get that time back and I wasted it all on something I show a bit of interest I don't want to do at all. I look at other stories of depression and feel jealous that they had more than one inerest or had any interests at all.  I just can't fucking explain it. I know I have my whole life ahead of me but then fucking high school, is starting and I wish I could be happy for it but now all I want to do is skip freshman year and go next year or just pretend I'm 13 and that I'm turning 14 next year and forget everything about last year or pretend I was born a year after I was. I wish life was that way. I just typed the first things on my mind because I can't think straight for some reason. I hope at least one person would understand this paragraph though.  I cant fucking  cope with my constant interest changes too because I was always that type of person to switch main inteerests every 5 or so months but no obsession I had has been as severe as the one to what i liked in 2020 the worst moment the one I wish had changed. I like something different now and I wished that was what my obsession was, not what it actually was. Better yet I could've been a normal person and what I was before then and had more than 1 interests at once.  .Anyways I just need to stop ruminating about the fucking past it is driving me crazy thats all Ive been doing 24/7 for the past 5/6 months I cant take it. . Every singe thing I see reminds me of it and I cant fucking take it. 

The reason my writing was so sloppy is because everyone I tell the story to they all mock me and say that my life is ahead of me and I should stop worrying and just instead of thinking about he past do those things now even though I fucking hate how I fucked up time and my life. 

I can tthink straight or tell this story straight I told it the most straightforward way I could and it still is a mindfuck comprehending what I can say. I just have so much on my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is 10 minutes after I wrote this I can think straight moreso. For some reason the main problem of this I cannot quite decipher in my mind in words. I know what it is, but I can't. I dont blame you if you don't understand my main problem in my paragraph, but I do have one. Id also rather have people say what my problem is then tell me just how to get over the past (most other people I see that have trobule getting over the past have a completely different problem of it than I do This is a throwway for obvious reasons since it would be an embarrasment to my main account that I put this on there."
1626,depression,My life is ruined but it's still not enough,"Imposter Man is what I secretly call my ex bc he's not the same person he used to be, at all.  And this new version of him is relentless in his efforts to manipulate and stage anything he can to just destroy me.  This version of him is like a toxin that poisons life around him, he's like a malicious cancer, a psychopath.  Im making some kind of a record of what I experience and how I interpret it bc I am afraid that if I don't, there will come a day when I'll be accused of not having seen it, not having an issue, that the moment when I couldve been validated will come and be dismissed bc I never said anything.  I'm afraid to say anything and who would I tell?  It sounds impossible and crazy.  But I do see it and I have no answer to get this person out of my life, is it any surprise he's such good friends with my stalker?  No, I think bad ppl keep like minded bed buddies (figure of speech but I just think they are cut from the same cloth)."
1627,depression,I‚Äôm completely lost,"For the past two years I‚Äôve been slowly losing my social life and covid had nothing to do with it. So in 2019 something happened in my life that left me emotionally devastated, I isolated myself for months. After a while I started coming out more and hanging out with friends but it never felt the same, I would come back home and immediately I would start crying. Over time I would become more and more introverted. Fast forward to now, I‚Äôve gotten worse, I have zero to no friends, I‚Äôve been contemplating giving up on life entirely, and I‚Äôve been feeling so damn empty that it hurts. I can‚Äôt talk to anyone to save my life, I‚Äôve become an extremely dry talker, and I just don‚Äôt have the motivation to put myself out there anymore. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with me and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. I feel alone and meaningless. What should I do to snap out of it?"
1628,depression,I imagine different scenarios where I kill myself,"These scenarios pop into my head when I‚Äôm laying on my bed, feeling miserable, and makes me want to cry.

The closest I‚Äôve been to doing it was 2 years ago, I felt this urge to crash my car into another or into a wall while driving on a highway.

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm actually depressed. I‚Äôd say that I feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù a half of my day, but I get sudden rushes of self-hate/regret/humilliantion feelings that make me want to kill myself, so that leads me to think about suicide daily. 

I hate everything I do, I hate who I am. I am socially retarded, academically useless. A plain waste of space, money and oxygen."
1629,depression,Any Advice?,"Disclaimer, I'm on a throwaway.

I come from a household where there is a lot of stigma and lots of shaming for anything relating to mental illness where there's a lot of the ""why can you just do it"" and the ""thanks I'm cured"" kind of attitude, so I haven't been medically diagnosed yet (I'm a teen (M) ), but I believe I might have some symptoms of depression. I've always thought I'd had it, so I thought it would be good to talk about coping advice with other people and recieve some validation rather than live in a kind-of limbo where I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really ""close"" to any members of my family because honestly, they haven't always been the greatest to me. For example when I was kid I quickly learned not to trust my parents because they would use things I said against me or punish me not so great ways, and this fallout would last in a week of screaming, crying, hiding etc. They don't even know what I like to do, my hobbies, and my skills etc. It's been better as a teen, but still I can't work off the past, so I often feel ""trapped"" or ""alone"". Their actions and behaviors definately manifested a lot of anxiety in me, and it took years before I could actually look people in the face (I still struggle to do that). Anyways, I think this might have been a large part in creating my supposed depression, but honestly I have no clue.

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays I have like waves of ""trances"" (if that's what I could call them?) where for days at a time I can't make myself do anything and I lose motivation (even taking a shower is hard) and I often can't make myself make food even if I'm hungry. In these periods I sleep like 18+ hours everyday until I have coldsweats and my parents always belittle me for being lazy, even though I feel horrible. The worse thing is that I'm losing motivation for things I like to do, and I just stare at the ceiling and feel bad about not doing anything. I just feel ""stuck/traped"" or ""in a dream"", if that makes sense? Like I wanna runaway/just not exist anymore. I also don't really ""feel"" anything? Like everything's just gray and uninteresting and I am not, per se, ""sad"", but I'm not like happy either.  I also recently heard about high-functioning depression and that really struck a chord with me. I appear pretty normal to my friends and ussually I can get things done, but right now it's gotten harder.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, because it's not diagnosed I can't get any kind of treatment, so I would love to have tips on how to just try to make it through? Personally I found daydreaming and just staring at the sky to be a bit effective, but I don't think that's a healthy coping mechanism... The stuff online isn't really helping either, so I thought maybe asking other people who have some similar experiences what to do?"

I‚Äôm not unmotivated, I want to get better and I‚Äôm ready to put in as much work as possible to get better. However I‚Äôm starting to worry that my entire life will be this struggle. I don‚Äôt know if I have the energy. Especially as I know things are likely to get more difficult. I worry that I‚Äôm fundamentally not able to do it. I can get far but then the smallest thing will break me. 

Even now, when things are looking up for me theres this dark cloud looming. Sometimes for no reason I start to feel it. Other times I just see it there, waiting for things to fall so it can cloud my mind again.

If I lose, well, at the end of the day I can kms and I won't need the money then.  Thinking I'll just yolo the rest of my savings into something.  I'll try to do it right, spend a month on DD, and then pull the trigger.  Either I become rich or I'll have an excuse to end it all when my calls expire worthless.  I suppose in a way I got bored of gambling with money and now I'm putting my life on the line too.  Cause having enough money not to work is the only way I can see out of depression and I sure as hell am not gonna get that money any other way."
1641,depression,"Still going strong, at least for now","Tl;dr traumatic childhood, shit luck in life


Backstory: I had a very abusive childhood, dad went to prison and mom was going guy to guy and I only remember one that was actually a good guy. I moved in with my grandma who was sick and was on oxygen. For over a year I took care of her before I went to school and after her hospice nurse left at night. I woke up one morning and found her, afterwards I had to move back in with my mom.
Her current boyfriend was on meth and extremely abusive to both of us. I had a fold out bed in the garage with a little desk and a computer that I would play games on to escape. I woke up countless nights to them fighting about sex and cheating and whatever else he could come up with. Me and my mom would pack up and leave and sleep in her car until she brought me to school the next day. We always ended up going back, he broke her arm and I got my ass kicked. She stayed with him.
One week I went camping with a friends family and when I came back they had both disappeared and nobody had seen either of them since I left.
I got put into foster care and eventually found out my mom moved 1500 miles away, I didn‚Äôt talk to her for 10 years.

So I have had issues with drugs and alcohol since I was like 13/14. Got expelled from multiple schools and ended up in a continuation school that probably saved my life at that point. That‚Äôs where I met my now wife. Once I graduated I started doing better with my depression, life was good, I was working a good job, driving a nice car, beautiful girlfriend‚Ä¶ etc‚Ä¶ the whole time I was kinda jealous that she had a family that loves her and I don‚Äôt, still feel that way.

Jump forward 8ish years. I‚Äôm clean except for a couple beers a week, We‚Äôre engaged, first baby on the way. I lose my job because the new owner wanted a whole new staff to pay them less. I find a new job that I hate but pays the bills and end up drinking more and more. Baby was born. Our home burned down and all we got out were us and the pets, also we just changed out insurance and it didn‚Äôt kick in for that yet so it was a total write off. Then my dog died. Then we moved out of the area and my wife could transfer but I couldn‚Äôt so I was out of a job and she was working full time while I watched the baby.

I‚Äôm at a point where I feel useless, I don‚Äôt feel fit to be a father. I‚Äôve dealt with depression my whole life and this is getting worse than it‚Äôs ever been. If it weren‚Äôt for my little princess I probably wouldn‚Äôt be here at this point. I know I need to be here for her, so she doesn‚Äôt deal with what I had to.

I have no family other than hers and my baby that‚Äôs too young to understand that daddy‚Äôs hurting thankfully, I have no friends because of moving. So I can‚Äôt just open up and vent to anybody"

Shes even been faking illness so she doesn‚Äôt have to come places. She talks on this chat room for grieving people since her dog died. All she does is talk to these depressed people online. All day, all night, at work, at home. Like she‚Äôs addicted to this chat room and it seems like all these people do is keep her in this depressive state (it‚Äôs the same ppl she talks to, she has friends on there). Also her dog died a year ago and she‚Äôs obsessively upset about it. She‚Äôs just as upset as the day he did died one year on and to me it just doesn‚Äôt make sense? Her dog was her baby but he was getting old and she‚Äôd always casually be mentioning ‚Äúah well when he dies we‚Äôll-‚Äú ‚Äúwell he‚Äôll probably pop his clogs soon and then-‚Äú but now he‚Äôs gone she cries every time he‚Äôs brought up. A year on. Every single conversation is about him as well. I‚Äôm not denying her grief but it‚Äôs very out of character for her and so unexpected. I‚Äôve even heard that she‚Äôs been more upset about the dog dying than when her own mother died. idk. Either way she definitely needs help but none of us know how to go about this.

It‚Äôs so lonely to immediately think of the same person when you‚Äôre happy, sad, bored, whatever and the moment you have their attention, words stop coming out. It‚Äôs even more frustrating to constantly need validation then when you receive it, it goes in one ear out the other.

I feel tired. Like everything sounds exhausting to do. I procrastinate as much as possible at work and doing home chores/tasks because it all seems pointless. What is the point of just working every single day, doing the same thing every. single. day. Always people in charge that do things backwards in terms of progress. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I hide the amount of work I‚Äôve automated because I‚Äôm tired of getting more work assigned. No promotion or advancement in sight so why bother. 

In my free time I play video games to delay things I should be doing. It‚Äôs not even fun, just whatever it takes to avoid doing that other thing. 

I‚Äôm not happy. I don‚Äôt remember just being at peace within the last year. There is always something to stress about. Whether its finances, or family deaths, or upcoming obligations, there is always some lingering problem to deal with. 

I would never kill myself, but I also wouldn‚Äôt mind just not being alive I guess. Like if I didn‚Äôt wake up, I don‚Äôt think Id be pissed about it.

1656,depression,I don't know what to do.,"So I'm having a rough time lately and thought if I ended everything it would benefit everyone involved. I miss my Dad and want to see him (he passed in March), my boyfriend is losing patience with my depression. I can't seem to get the motivation to do anything than head to work and get something to eat. There's more, but I can't remember at the moment.

So I've never self-harmed before. I don't know what happened, or why, and I hoped it was a bad dream. I took an x-acto knife and started cutting.

I wanted to, but I also feel like I didn't. I was hoping to hit a decently sized vein, and that my blood was thin enough (I'd taken ibuprofen for a headache) to just kinda work. 

I missed the major veins. Part of it was likely on purpose. I think. 

So I'm panicking and don't know what to do. They're too obvious and chaotic to explain as something else. I haven't told anyone and am worried someone might notice. I have them covered with large bandaids and am changing them frequently and applying Neosporin hoping to avoid scarring. 

So, I guess. Where do I go from here? What if someone finds out? How do I hide them? 

Thanks."

But I'm stuck at a job I hate, likely going to get fired at this rate, thousands in debt, deep in depression, and lacking anyone I'm close to besides family. 

People know about my mental problems but they don't understand just how bad they are. Every day when I drive to work the only reason I don't drive into oncoming traffic is putting others at risk. The only reason I don't slit my wrists or shoot myself is the mess and the chance my little sister would find me.

I don't want to live. All I want is to die at this point. If I could die and have it not inconvenience anyone I cared about then I would do it in a heartbeat.

I even had a good day yesterday. Made some bad choices but it wasn't a bad day. But tonight I feel worse than ever. It'd just be so easy at this point."

1664,depression,Struggling a lot with overthinking things. Need honest advise,"Probably my biggest fantasy is to not have my guard up 24/7 with everyone. Being able to open up to someone, or rely on someone.

Now there are two major problems with this. Firstly, will this ever happen? Will I ever be normal enough to let it happen? Or will I scare away everyone with my insecurities and psychological problems.
Secondly, if this does happen, is it really wise to let your guard down with anyone? The vast vast majority of people are assholes, waiting for a chance to take advantage of you, what are the odds the person I let my guard down to won't be one? Not great tbh. And why would anyone even wanna carry my mental burdens? What does anyone owe me to begin with? Why would anyone put themselves through it for me?

It seems of someone is willing to go through with it, it is unlikely they're doing it for me. Odds are they're gonna use whatever they get against me eventually.

So a major question that arises is, is it even worth it, to think about and seek companionship? Is the burden on my brain worse, or is the risk of someone taking advantage of me, and leaving me ten times as broken and insecure worse?

And that leads us to the most important question. Is any of it worth it to begin with? Is living worth it? If both the outcomes of the game end in tremendous/prolonged suffering, why play at all? Is it not the humane thing to do to just put myself out of this misery early on?

I really am looking for one good logical reason as to why ending it isn't the kindest/best thing?"

1671,depression,"It's hard to be the eldest. At this moment, I want to end everything.","I am now currently 20, female. And for the past few months, life for me has been really hard. I was 18 when my mom died and since then, I stood as the mother of the family, because my father seems to only work and goes home to either eat, bath, or sleep. It's been so hard since I am now in college and at the same time tending to the needs of my younger siblings, the younger one is a senior high school, while the youngest in elementary.

I feel it suffocating, there are times where my father doesn't give money leading me to find ways to have some just to survive the month. I want to enjoy my younger years but it seems that I was given a heavier responsibility and I can't get away with it. Bills needed to be paid, food needed for survival, also some debts to pay. I want to work, but there are a lot of circumstances hindering me to do so. 

We only stay at our grandmother's house (my mom's mother) and don't even own one. There are times where we fight because of the financial matters. With that, for the past 2 years, those exhausted me, and the effects are quite visible now. My academic performance was affected, I became more introverted, I feel trouble sleeping and then overslept or vice versa, I don't have appetite to do anything, I only eat once or twice a day (because I am always nagged to do so), but if I am not reminded, I don't eat for the whole day.

As I am writing this, I am crying, I have no one to tell these struggles, I want to see a psychologist or seek any medical help, but I don't have money. I have quite few friends and it's just that, I just don't want to reach out to them.

1672,depression,I don't know how to cope with this anymore,"26 y/o, suffered with depression and anxiety since uni and at this point I am coming to terms with the fact I have  pretty much ruined my life. I'm functional - I work full time, cook for myself etc but I am completely dead inside. I have no motivation to do anything except sit in bed on my phone/laptop, I'm apathetic to everything, I don't know what happiness feels like. I waste my days away in my bedroom. I have no friends because I pushed them all away. I broke up with my perfect partner of 5 years because I didn't have the mental capacity to be in a healthy relationship and felt like he deserved way better. I regret it. 

I'm completely alone and it's all my fault. 

I haven't been able to commit to therapy on multiple occasions and I'm too scared to take medication from previous bad side effects. I force myself to go to the gym and it does nothing. I eat healthy for weeks and it does absolutely nothing for me.  I don't know what to do,  I feel like I'll never be able to overcome this. It's getting worse as the years go on. 

I want to cease existing... yet I am too scared to kill myself. How pathetic. I'm doomed to live out this shitty life a complete shell of my existence and forced to deal with the bad decisions I make daily. Going on 6 years now and there's no end in sight."
1673,depression,"I'm horrible, confidence is a bitch to get.","God, I've been trying my best to work kn my confidence. But it can never work, which makes me question if I'm truly really a man or not.

Being me (17M) is the worst, man. Being overweight, horrible voice, not athletic at all, with no necessary skills or talent, do you know how hard it is to get confidence as the way I am? I've been even trying to go to the gym or even exercise, but it's so embarrassing knowing my family even fucking teases me about it. And as many times as I asked my parents about the gym, they just usually forget it. 

It definitely doesn't help the fact I failed my current school year thanks to taking virtual classes, and now I'm most likely going to lose most of my friends, and get judged much, much more.

I wanna make myself better, but it's so hard to focus on that, as well as other things like my school is reopening soon. That's going to shorten my time so much. I dont know what to do. I hate myself. I hate being me. I can barely name anything good about myself. To be honest, sometimes I just wished I never fucking existed.

Sorry, this was a entire vent that I held in for a while. If I got aggressive or too much, sorry but I'm keeping it in. If I did, means that it kinda came from somewhere deep within."

This is fucking weird but since my therapy appointment early this week and being diagnosed with ptsd....I've felt numb.

I can't tap into any feelings. I feel immense guilt because I can't feel love or happiness for those around me. 

I get frustrated a lot because I don't know how I'm feeling???? How is that possible?? I'm opening the box in my head that says feelings and it's empty. 

I feel quite apathetic if I don't think too hard about it but I normally think too hard about it 

I keep, I think it's disassociating??, like I'm there but I'm not there. 

I'll be stood looking for something and it stops feeling like I'm there at the super market or I've stopped working or I'm working but myself isn't?? Everything almost feels distorted but I know it's not

1676,depression,If you don't want to hear the truth how I feel. Then don't ask the fucking question!!,"If you don't want to hear the truth how I feel. Then don't ask the fucking question! 

So many people I left me in red after I have told them how I feel. Why ask the question if you didn't care about answer.! My so-called friends have turned their backs on me. And I knew them for 20 and 10yers. But that meant nothing apparently... 6 head surgeries in one year that was 5 years ago destroyed my life. I can only walk 700m 2 times a day I can't be in a large group of people. I wake up every morning feeling like shit. It literally feels like I have to climb Everest every day!! And I have people that have honestly told me to be happier. And they are the same people that complain over one year of being isolated. Try 5 fucking years!!!!! So don't tell me what to do when you are weaker! If I'm unlucky my life I destroyed forever. And that I never can manage a full-time job. 

One year after my surgery I did rehabilitation and studied up my Grades. I got top top grades and improved my condition at the same time. So I'm weak? Yeah fucking right. It took me 2,5 years to do it but I got it done! Went from walking 70m once a day to 500m 2 times a day 

Then when I wanted to try rehabilitation and University on 50% distance. I almost did one course. But I had to fight with the system at the same time. So I got a big backlash. Thank you society. So now I go in my walk and spend the rest of my time in bed. 

I will probably get a lot of hate for this but it can't be worse than being rejected 100 times. ( probably more I have lost count)

I need to talk about dating as an ish ugly and depressed man with health problems. My experiences with dating haven't been good. I have been rejected, block, and ignored more than I can remember. All I hear is what's wrong with me. It has gotten to the point that I now believe them... Anxiety and loneness are a part of my daily life. 
Something that is really provocative is when girls say ‚Äúgood boys don't exist‚Äù and I'm over here like ‚Äú yes we do but I was apparently too ugly and boring for you‚Äù I'm not going to lie I had 7 months when I wasn't lonely. I meet my first girlfriend and finally lost my virginity. The problem was that she was toxic. So I had to leave that relationship. But apparently, I was good for her because I was her first. And 2 months later she found a new one. So I did something right. The reason why she was bad for me was that she started a lot of fights and when she got upset she said some really horrible things just to put me down. When I broke up she said some nasty stuff. Now once did I say anything bad back. I even had other people reading it and I asked them If I did or say something wrong. And trust me dose people would tell me if I did something wrong. Even if that was difficult I don't regret anything. Now 2 years later I'm back to being rejected so a part of me thinks that I should have stayed. My therapist doesn't agree. üòÇ 

So why doesn't a man who never would take his partner for granted, be there for her when she needs you ( even after me breaking up yes I didn't ignore all here messages I answered even too all the really mean stuff) I will give you a few reasons. 1 I'm not ‚Äúcool or macho‚Äù 2 I'm short 3 I don't look good 4 I'm not confident 5 I have health issues 6 I'm depressed. There we go I have given you some reasons üòÇ you might say that you don't want a macho man. But if we look back to school growing up. Who got all the girls?  One thing for sure it wasn't me. What I have realized after talking to A LOT of people is the a lot of girls want a bad boy that they can turn good. My only hope is to find the few who just want a good boy. And yes I know that you girls exist. The only problem with you is that you 99% of the time already have found the love of your life. And to put a disclaimer out I'm not hating on girls I just tell you why I feel the way I do. And trust me I know I'm far from perfect. But I will be there for you 24/7 even if I have mad anxiety, I will never take you for granted and I will tell you regularly that you are my light in this dark tunnel and that I'm so lucky to have you. You might wonder how I am when I'm really depressed. What I probably will say is that you deserve someone better than me. The girl that can handle that is an angle. Thank you for reading my rant. I hope that you will get through whatever you are battling and I wish you the best. Damn I just realized that I haven't told you about my health issues. I already have a post about it I will link it. Thank you.

I have lived 5 years of hell so far."
1677,depression,Expat feeling like everything is against me,"Hi guys. I hope it is okay to post here. I'm in a really tricky situation and feel like I don't have the tools and will to cope or to make the situation better.

I moved to Spain from NZ about 5 months ago. I had been thinking about moving to Europe for so many years, and a few years ago I met my Spanish partner and finally had the right excuses and conditions to go. I knew I would be supported, financially and otherwise, through the whole thing. Admittedly, moving overseas during covid from somewhere covid-free to Spain of all places was not the best idea, but I was sick of letting the virus put brakes on my life, and my partner got a good offer back home. So he moved here, set up a flat etc, and I followed 2 months later with a student visa and enough savings to survive without a job for up to a year. I was so excited, and even though I had to leave my best friend and my family, there was so much hope in my future, and so much support from my loved ones.

Fast forward nearly five months, and I really am understanding the idea of the 'black dog'. I've had bouts of depression before, but never like this. There are a few moving pieces for me:

* Firstly, a chronic illness I've been trying to get a diagnosis for for a year is flaring up big time and flattening me like a steamroller. This isn't new, just particularly bad at the moment, and I'm losing the ability to do hobbies that keep my mental health in check (piano, running, gym etc). I've been able to get a few hours worth of work a week, but I really have to keep myself in check because if I don't get 9-10 hours of sleep a night, plus a nap during the day often, I can't cope even with the small amount of work that I do have.
* Secondly, the beauracracy here is pretty horrific, and so anything from getting a visa to getting a doctor's appointment feels like walking through sludge. It feels like the  whole damn government is against me some days.
* Thirdly, the Spanish course I signed up for a paid an excessive amount of money for has been such an absolute let down. I love learning languages in general, but I lost any kind of drive within a few short weeks. I feel entirely unchallenged, one of our teachers is an asshole (i.e. bullies students, makes us feel bad for making mistakes etc), and I have tried to fix a lot of the problems for myself by pushing to move up a level and trying to ask another teacher for help with the asshole teacher, but inevitably nothing happens. For instance, I asked to move up a level, and they literally would not let me move. I asked for a level test to prove that the level I'm currently in is not challenging me, and they wouldn't even let me take it. I spend 4 hours/day in this class, and it is draining me entirely. 
* Fourthly, obviously I'm very far from home and have no way of going back. I haven't felt overly homesick too many times, and I have been keeping in touch with my best friend and my family a lot. However, I'm quite frustrated because my partner keeps mentioning things at random about how he wishes he had stayed, gotten residency, how he misses certain aspects of life in NZ that we don't get over here, etc. These comments make me a bit homesick, and some days I spiral a bit thinking about what we could do if we went back. Of course, things would have been so much easier for me if I had stayed. I wouldn't have to deal with visa crap, I would be able to speak the language easily, and if I needed to go to the doctor I just could.
* Lastly, I'm not sure. I feel like I can put my finger on some of the things making me feel like crap, but sometimes I'm just sad or angry and I don't know why. Some days I don't want to get out of bed and eat. Other days I'm fine until I get a pang of pain or get frustrated during class and the rest of the day just completely sucks.

I'm not entirely sure where I'm going with this, but I guess I just needed to vent a little bit. I spent so much time, money and energy on this move, just to arrive here and feel like the world is against me. I knew it was going to be hard, yet it's completely defeating me at the moment. And I feel like I would just be so ashamed of having to go back home, tail between my legs, and potentially losing my partner in the process if he couldn't/wouldn't come back with me."
1678,depression,College Failure,"Warning: lengthy post lol

This past year I have been more depressed than ever. I started university and my first semester grades were not great, but I had concurrent credit that keep me afloat and away from academic probation. (Although up until just recently I thought I was on academic probation at the time bc they made me sign this really confusing form and also I'm dumb.) I was very depressed during that time but ignoring it, pretending it wasn't there &amp; hoping it would just go away on its own. Spring semester rolled around, and every single course I enrolled in ended up being online. I was like, okay, this is fine. It was a new semester. I could adapt to it, right? Unfortunately, I could not. I really did try for the first few weeks, but my depression got the best of me. All this work being online, with no tangible difference between school &amp; break (we also did not have a spring break which was around when things started to get really bad for me), no sense of schedule, and my absolute lack of motivation made attempting to succeed a horrendous failure for me. I was finding it hard to function and eventually just stopped doing anything school related. I lost contact with everyone. I was so sure that I was just going to fail out of college regardless. I was intent on killing myself because I couldn't deal with all of the stress and depression. End of the semester rolled around, and I ended up failing every class. To my surprise, I didn't get kicked out of university (like I said, I'm dumb and thought I was already on probation). Instead, I've now been placed on academic probation. However, I also apparently lost my financial aid, which is as good as getting kicked out to me. I didn't know this until recently, and I feel terrible. I feel bad for making my parents lose money. A few weeks ago they asked to see my grades and I forged them a bit because I was afraid they would kick me out or something if they knew the truth. They think my GPA is 2 point something, but it's really much lower. I can't appeal the school for financial aid because I would need a note from a counselor or someone along those lines. I can't really afford a counselor in the first place, and I've never seen any kind of psychiatrist so I have also never been diagnosed with depression. My parents just recently found out that my student loans were returned so they're going to have to pay that back. They got upset and they don't understand why since I wasn't honest about what my actual grades were. All F's is an unofficial withdrawal which means I lose my student loans. I need to confess and tell them but I don't know how. I'm at a loss as to what to do. I want to die but I don't have a good way of killing myself. I felt like my depression was just starting to get a tiny bit better, as I had planned to maybe transfer down to a community college and figure things out from there. But now I have to fix this financial situation and I feel terrible for being such a burden on my parents. I'm ridden with anxiety and I don't know how to tell them that I lied and that I was actually doing much worse academically. I wish I could go back and change the past.

I didn't mean to make this post so long, but I'm just trying to get my feelings down. I wish I could talk to a friend but I'd ghosted all of them. If anyone has any advice or just anything to say in general, it would be greatly appreciated."
1679,depression,(Rant) Being stuck,"I started a new job, I was only there for a day and half cause I panicked about this being my life, the same job that I've worked before over and over since highschool and I keep asking if this is it. Am I just going to keep doing the same thing, talk about what you did over the weekend over and over again. 

I asked for help and they referred me to do online courses (CBT) which I am doing but it's basic things to do if you just Google depression and how to deal with it. Everytime I do a course again the question of is this it? Am I just not going to be helped? runs through my mind and that just puts me even deeper into a depressed state.

I'm just writing this to try clear my mind of something, of what I don't think I'll ever know."
1680,depression,I was doing so well and I think I‚Äôm back to square one- so much has happened,"I think I need to explain everything before I can fully express how empty I feel right now. 

Not that long I meet a guy, that I‚Äôve already previously talked about before, who knew he would have such a significant impact on me when everything was short lived. 

Anyways I meet him in a rough time and I think I used him as a distraction to the chaos of emotions that I felt. Now this is already bad I know but to make it even worse he wasn‚Äôt the best. He would purposely try to make me feel/look stupid and at one point told me that I ‚Äúlacked common sense‚Äù all to which I would brush off. And thats not the problem because these things that he would do towards me really wouldn‚Äôt affect me. I knew that his opinion of me was of little value. So why even go back? Well I think my problem is that I‚Äôve never truly felt loved by someone and although he verbally sucked he offered comfort in the forms of physical touch. I‚Äôm not naive or stupid I knew that to him I was seen as someone dumb but usable. This was later proven true when he randomly stopped texting me which again didn‚Äôt hurt. 

What did hurt was the fact that in that short amount of time I became dependent on the physical touch that made me feel not so empty and sad. So when that stopped I truly felt devastated. Which is a weird thing might I add, crying not for a person but what that person could provide. 

But let me further explain, he didn‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm dealing with depression and that whenever it came to us cuddling and him kissing me it felt like I was whole. It made me forget everything because this was something that I never experienced and found out I loved. My mom /family was never the one to show affection especially if it was physical. I couldn‚Äôt tell you of a time that I hugged or that my mother hugged me, she also was never the one to verbally demonstrate affection. So when I started to feel affection it became really emotional for me. I never knew how much I needed that/ was deprived of. 

Funny because I‚Äôve always dealt with my depression alone and although he never knew it those few days that we were together i didn‚Äôt feel so lonely. 

Anyways the aftermath of that was even worse than I had originally been in. I felt alone and empty and like the whole weight of my sadness was back on me. I spent it the first few days trying to convince myself that I was fine before I gave in and fully allowed myself to feel sad. The sadness lasted a while and for a minute I thought that was my breaking point. But one day I got up and told myself I no longer wanted to deal with my depression and for some reason I began to feel better, there was a couple of things that I knew would trigger me and I purposely avoided them. 

Yet for some reason today I began to go through the whole motions of feeling alone and it came back really hard. At this point it hurts to open up to others so I don‚Äôt know what to do."

1683,depression,Counselling recommended!,"I had my first counselling session yesterday. I was weirdly calm, considering I had a big panic attack when going to the doctors the day before! I think it was because I knew counselling is what I need and that it will help me. 

It went really well, we actually have a lot in common! She asked me what I wanted when the sessions ended- I said I wanted to feel that I wasn‚Äôt crazy and also a letter that says I‚Äôm sane like they do on all the films. 

I cried on her-lots!

I laughed with her- a bit. 

I realised I was probably born in the wrong era-most of my morals are from the 1930s, like keeping private life on the down low (no arguments outside, that kind of thing)

I told her most things (we couldn‚Äôt cover all the bases as I had already gone over my time by half hour!) I had a major headache all day afterwards but she said that may happen. I also slept like a baby, something that hasn‚Äôt happen for AGES! 

I still don‚Äôt feel ready for work and I doubt I‚Äôll feel ready for a while yet, but at the moment, I don‚Äôt even care! 

She said we have a lot to work on but she knows I can do it with her help. 

I feel this is the beginning of an end‚Ä¶ but then I‚Äôm having a good day today so I‚Äôll probably feel like shit tomorrow and wonder why on Earth I‚Äôm doing all this!

I would love to lie and say that covid made me this way, but it didn‚Äôt. Not going to lie, a year before covid started I was getting a lot better but then I moved again and my desperation got worse.

I moved a lot as a child because we were poor. And we always have been.
I look at other teenagers and think ‚Äúwow, I wish I had that house,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI wish I had friends to visit and watch movies with them.‚Äù 
My mom told me one night while she was drunk that my (alcoholic) father wanted her to abort me because he didn‚Äôt want a girl.
I hate my dad and he knows it, I‚Äôve hated him since I was small. He told me mother that I can‚Äôt rightfully kick him out of my life until I‚Äôm 18. I messaged him on Facebook and told him that I never want to hear from him again. He never even opened the message but he updated his profile picture yesterday. 

He never cared about me. That‚Äôs another thing, I‚Äôm that clich√© ‚Äúblack girl with a deadbeat father‚Äù. Hence why I now only like white/Hispanic/ Asian guys. And that‚Äôs a serious fucking issue that I am so ashamed of, But all 7 of my siblings have different fathers who are all black and they all don‚Äôt give a shit about either one of us. I am just so afraid I‚Äôll continue the cycle if I date a black man.

I wish I was a white girl, with a nice boyfriend who falls at my feet for literally just standing there and being blonde with a cup titties.

I‚Äôve had a crush on my best friend who moved to california, miles and miles away from me, since the third grade and I‚Äôm about to be a junior now.

Time is going too fast and I can‚Äôt keep up. I can‚Äôt make new friends anymore, I don‚Äôt feel passion for the things that I used to, I have urges to hurt myself and other people who have done me wrong. 

The world would be so much better without people like me."
1692,depression,I‚Äôm so tired of wishing I was dead.,"I think about wanting to be dead, or killing my self at least three times a day. I‚Äôm overwhelmed with the burden my depression has created for me and my family. I‚Äôm exhausted trying to be ‚Äúmindful‚Äù and grateful, and letting go and fighting a LITERAL war inside my head. How can I go on indefinitely with this? I can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs why I want to be dead."

I am severely suicidal, have low self worth and hate being around people because it makes me anxious to the point of wanting to break down on the spot. This has gotten to the point where I don't want to leave my room or talk to any human being at all. I get so paranoid with people that I automatically believe that they believe what I believe about myself. Even if I'm told the opposite I always feel like I'm right and that their lying. I can't help it. I get so paranoid that I see things mostly in the night, I see wierd shadows that seem like demons. I'm always wanting them to kill me because I can't do it myself. In the day time I just get paranoid that someone is there watching me when I'm alone. When it comes to my few friends and lover I just believe that if I do something wrong it will ruin our whole relationships and I start getting worked up over little things and get compelled to say sorry about everything. I get paranoid that they all don't care about me, that I'm annoying. I know it's dumb but even when they reassure me I just believe my own thoughts. Doctors are no help because I can't bring myself to trust any of them. I just feel like dying and that I'm a waste of space. I'm basically insane at this point so there's no use anyway, I'm just a fuck up."

I thought this was my dream job but now it's awful.  The harrassing guy told all my coworkers I go around reporting people so everyone is avoiding me plus the original harrassment has never stopped.  I have social anxiety so it's already hard for me to deal with people.

I lost a child custody battle recently because the other party had more money for better lawyers an kept appealing every decision until they got the verdict reversed.  

I broke up with two lifelong friends because their own mental health issues caused them to blow up on me.  I have reached such a low mental health point I couldn't take it anymore.  Finding unprompted angry text my ""friend"" wrote me again and again I couldn't handle it.  I don't usually cry but I broke down about this.  I am  approavhing middle an"

To put this all into context I‚Äôll need to add that I am 19 and I cook in Detroit, the food scene is great and and cooking is my passion. It has saved my life and I love it more then anything. When I go and work everything outside it stops. All of my problems just fade away for the 5 hour service we have. I only focus on making people happy and I cannot describe to you the feeling I get when I see somebody get served the food I pour my heart and my soul into and they just smile. I know it‚Äôs probably a little hard to understand, (like it‚Äôs just food who gives a fuck) but this is truly my life‚Äôs passion. But to get the actual point. The thing I love most is killing me. This is the first time I have ever admitted that I have depression. I am the person who suffers silently and who will never ask for help. It‚Äôs just not who I am. My parents have no clue, nor do my brothers. My girlfriend has some idea but I hate burdening her with my shit because i don‚Äôt want her to worry. Working 70 hours a week is really fucking tough. I get up go to work and go home. Rinse and repeat. I‚Äôve developed just a sadness about my life. I lay awake at night just thinking how I‚Äôm gonna keep doing this for the next 40 years. And yes the easy answer would be to just switch careers. I could do that but I it‚Äôs easy working these hours. It‚Äôs just really hard to watch everybody else around me living life while I just work. I have lost 30 pounds in 6 months. And I just feel like I‚Äôm drowning. Again sorry this is so long but I just needed to vent to people I‚Äôll never meet."
1701,depression,Thank you for all the support everyone has given me here,Huge thank you. I am very grateful.

1705,depression,It gets harder every day,I have been dealing with depression since as long as I can remember im currently 18(m) I just can't. I cant remember stuff its said straight to my face I forget it 5 sec later I feel so stupid I messed up my graduation walk today in practice an I got laughed at now im worrying it'll happen on Friday in actual graduation ik the teachers mock an hate me I can see it in all their faces. I went to drop off my school laptop an then the lady says √óthis is the boy I'm talking about√ó straight to my face an the other teachers started laughing I felt so embarrassed I asked what I did an they laughed more. May own parents have been mocking me since I was a kid bcs of this. I hate it. They would usually put som down an tell me to search for it knowing I'd forget the location and laugh while the item is literally infront of me. Idk if this gave me ptsd but when im asked to look for something I get so nervous an start sweating. With depression I've also lost sleep I sleep at 4am every single day. I barley eat at all if not for days. I currently moved away from my mom to live with my dad bcs we never got along but my dad is worst he mocks me for my eating disorder. An sometimes pushes me an laughs saying im weak. I hate it. And not to talk about relationships too. I've only dated two girls in my life an it was online I've never met them ever. The last girl I was so in love with started treating me like shit. The most hurtful thing she said was √ówhen I think of you I feel nothing√ó she made me so happy so fucking happy just to say that. On top of that she sent a vid of her an the guy she cheated on me with in her room. I ghosted her an she came back months later saying she had sex with him. Which hurted being that we planned on meeting up an doing it. But I'm currently a virgin. I always tried to have a smile on my face while talking to her I remembered days she cried to me an I made her laugh. Taking on her pain as mine. Now when I see ppl happy I feel empty and dead. An the pressure of finding someone to hold on to is getting to me. With the pressure of being mocked as an 18yr virgin. I look around in my mind trying to think of something or someone who makes me happy and all I have is me. I'm trying to love myself more but its difficult. Idk anymore the days go by an I get tired more an more. I need help.
1706,depression,Redundancy of Life,"I find myself having such a poor and rotten mood almost all the time, and putting on a facade when I'm with people/on a call. And for the past year it's just been the same thing day in and day out. Walks help sometimes but it's like I know I'm trying to merely distract myself. It's the same with video games. I'm not ready to live an adult life and the thought of the cycle of waking up, going to work, coming home, and then sleeping only to repeat until I die, maybe with the occasional fun on weekends, makes me sick to my stomach. I think about killing myself when I shower, and while I try to fall asleep. My roommate seems to in essence ignore me and goes out to do things and hang out on their own. I think if I killed myself people won't find out until months after the fact; maybe they wont notice at all. I don't interact with many people if at all. I haven't been sleeping well either. I guess I'm just venting here. I feel so lonely, I ought to just curl up and die. I don't think there's a place for me in this world; it's not worth making one."

1709,depression,Finally doing better (for now),"Just wanted to document this for myself and maybe motivate or lift up others. If hearing/reading about others doing better and finding motivation just makes you feel worse, I understand, I‚Äôve been there, but please don‚Äôt read this. 

After 3 months of laying in bed all day, everyday just with my thoughts and sleeping 3/4 of the day, my aunt practically forced me to join her in a zumba class yesterday. I don‚Äòt know what happened or where I got that energy from, but jumping around in a room full of middle aged women (I‚Äòm 22) somehow made fun once I didn‚Äòt give a f** how I looked doing it. 

After that I fell asleep early yesterday and today I‚Äòm awake much earlier than usually (8 am, for people who work that‚Äòs nothing, I know, but I usually try to sleep until I can‚Äòt anymore until 2 pm). I kind of have the energy to go for a morning run while listening to loud music right now and want to actually do something for my bachlor thesis after that. Crazy plans I know. Writing it here to somehow remind myself of that hope, energy and motivation that I‚Äòm feeling in the moment, before it passes (like it usually does).

I also started taking Vitamin D supplements (but that was like 2 days ago, so I don‚Äòt think it made any difference until now) but I really like the feeling of finally having done something good for myself. Please god don‚Äòt take this feeling of motivation away before I at least accomplish a little bit today. 

If someone read this, I wish you all the motivation in the world today. Try to get Vitamin D. If you can‚Äòt make it out of bed today, it‚Äòs ok. Try to open the window on your way to the toilet when you have to go and just stand a few minutes in the fresh air and maybe the sun if it shines through that window. Try to be proud of yourself because you made it through another day. And maybe, if you are lucky enough like me to have someone who can force you to go out and do something, tell them! Maybe sometimes we can‚Äòt force ourselves, but someone else can. (Not in all cases, I understand that, but sometimes.) Take every little hormone, that makes you feel better, you can with you!"

I occasionally have random bursts of hope. That I will get things together, and I‚Äôll get to do the things I want to do. Hang out with friends, travel etc. But there‚Äôs also part of me that worries that even if I get to do these things, I‚Äôll still have this void inside me. Maybe the void will be a bit smaller, but it will always be there. Like a storm cloud of worry, sadness, and emptiness that never truly leaves."

But last 2 weeks i'm barely functioning. Some small things happened, that might just be inconveniences for anyone else, but they are destroying me form the inside.

I haven't talked to friends in weeks, I barely eat and I'm afraid I'm gonna be fired soon, because I can barely come to work, let alone do something.

1717,depression,I always asked myself if I‚Äôd be able to feel anything when someone I knew was going to die. I found out today.,"I‚Äôve (m23) been bipolar for probably close to twelve years now. It feels like my empathy and compassion has eroded away to the point of barely feeling anything anymore. I‚Äôm not sure if I love my family; I don‚Äôt feel any real attachment to them any more.

Anyways, today my step-father (m41) was admitted to the ICU with acute liver failure, and it looks like he is not going to make it. 

My mom (m47) called me to talk about it, she said he was getting a blood transfusion but it might not matter. She sounded shaken up, and the first thing I told her was, ‚Äúthat sucks.‚Äù I felt no emotion or shock at the news or what I said. I responded as if someone had told me that their plant died or they missed a bus.

I realized that I must be pretty numb, and that I might be decaying in my own quiet way. 

My step dad and I never really got along, he was kind of a douche, but I realized that he was also something of a victim, an addict who was orphaned relatively young. I still think I should be able to feel something, but all this has done is show me how much I‚Äôve really wilted away."
1718,depression,How to help my friend?,"Hi, I‚Äôm very worried about my friend. He suffers from severe depression and other issues. 
Yesterday he told me how bad he has been feeling again and I am very sad because of it. I cannot stand it seeing him suffering all the time and this really drags me down sometimes. 
When he opened up to me about his problems the first time, I‚Äôve have always been there for him and I was actually able to convince him to see a therapist. It was better for a while but I don‚Äôt know how long it has been since he is feeling worse again. 

I try to be as supportive as possible and tell him how I‚Äôm always standing by his side, care about him and all‚Ä¶ but since his depression has got so severe once again, I feel like I am useless and not doing a good job at helping him. I mean he trusts me and all because if he didn‚Äôt, he would have never opened up to me. 

Do you guys know how I can support him? And/Or what I can tell him to feel a bit better?
I‚Äôm afraid that he might does something stupid and I want him to find happiness and a reason to live on again."
1719,depression,I‚Äôm shocked,"I was on the phone with my mom earlier tonight, and my sister came into my moms room and asked her if I was ok because she knows how bad I‚Äôve been feeling lately. I‚Äôm so fixated on that because it‚Äôs surprising to me that anyone would care about my well-being in general. But yes, I know It‚Äôs such a small thing, but for a second, I felt like I was actually worth something and not just an absolute worthless piece of shit, and it made me smile. I feel weird lol üôÉ"
1720,depression,"I‚Äôm being referred for an ECT consultation, how has it gotten to this point?","I (23M) have PDD, my whole life has been bleak since childhood. I was always sensitive, although I was smiling more due to the innocence of childhood and exploring the world, I was shy and lived far away from people I went to school with. I failed to connect with people outside of a school environment. My parents worked a lot so I‚Äôd come home to essentially an empty home and a babysitter who was no replacement for a parent. I had no one to talk to if I was proud of something or sad. This caused me to become desperate for friends which pushed people away. 

I managed to stumble into a relationship in college but my ex gf abused me both emotionally and physically. I was left with all of my negative self beliefs validated by someone I thought loved me. I haven‚Äôt been intimate with anyone since that time and developed a strong distrust of people‚Äôs intentions (4 years ago). I have a few people I somehow met in college that I still sometimes see since we graduated but they all have more important people in their lives. I‚Äôm not important to anyone and I feel invisible. There‚Äôs nothing I offer that someone else can‚Äôt and they probably won‚Äôt be a miserable loser. No one besides my doctors and family knows about my condition and no one knows just how torturous everyday is for me.

Waking up is a disappointment and existing is tiring trying to pretend everything is ok. Meds haven‚Äôt worked since 8th grade and therapy/hospitals haven‚Äôt remedied anything either. My psychiatrist talked to me and said they‚Äôve tried a lot and nothing has helped much so ECT should be strongly considered since my blood work is normal, no nutritional deficiency I guess. I have a consultation tomorrow. 

How has it reached this point? To have my body go through seizures to be happy? This is all I‚Äôve known, I‚Äôve never imagined being happy realistically. I‚Äôm risking my memories and ability to function at work for a non guaranteed chance at happiness. Is it worth it? Do I deserve happiness? This is all so much and I feel like I‚Äôve disappointed my family for being so sad for 23 years. They‚Äôve given me so many opportunities and I can‚Äôt even be happy. If anyone has experience with ECT I‚Äôd love to hear."
1721,depression,"i really don‚Äôt think school is for me, but there‚Äôs no other option. everything feels meaningless and school has numbed me","i hate school. of course mostly everyone hates school, for typical reasons like having to get up early, homework, studying and what not. yeah those suck obviously, but my hatred for school goes beyond that. school pains me so goddamn much. it probably doesn‚Äôt help that i live in a really homogenous closed in suburban small town, so the people here are snobby and closed minded. but besides that, i can‚Äôt imagine sitting inside a room listening to someone drone on about things i‚Äôll end up cramming the day before a test and forgetting them after for 8 hours, on repeat for the next 3 years. and after those 3 years, that‚Äôs not even the end of it bc i‚Äôll have to do the same with college. and then what happens after college? i have no passion for anything. life is so uninteresting to me. i used to be a very curious and excited sociable child, but i‚Äôm so damn numb to everything now. and on top of all of that, i have to pull all nighters studying and forgetting, half assing homework, study and forget, so on. i don‚Äôt think i can handle it anymore. the thought of doing this for another 3+ years enough for me to wanna kill myself. the staff at my school doesn‚Äôt give a shit for anyone, they just hang up mental health posters for show, yet never do anything about the insane fucking workload we have. i forgot to mention that my school in particular is very competitive, so our curriculum is more hardcore than other schools. i just cant keep up anymore. the education system expects a very specific character from students, and if you don‚Äôt fit nicely inside of that you‚Äôll get left behind. i can feel myself dragging further and further away from that character. and i don‚Äôt want to fit inside it either. i just wanna have fun. i wanna enjoy things too. i know life is supposed to have its struggles, but why do i have to be dragged through hell and back in exchange for temporary surface level happiness? why cant it last? why do i consider killing myself 10 times before genuinely smiling 1 time? i cant keep repeating this cycle any longer. i think i‚Äôll hurt myself if it keeps going on like this. i‚Äôm trapped."

1730,depression,I hate being conscious,"Imagine that after you die, you awaken as a form of conscious as you are now, except you have no body, no feelings, no senses, and there is absolutely nothing that you can perceive. You are then left in this form of consciousness eternally. Now think of how it feels when you are completely out of breath, how it may feel to be suffocating or drowning. Pretend that on top of being conscious in a void of absolute nothingness, you also experience this extremely uncomfortable feeling of suffocation eternally. Firstly, this thought experiment on death makes the conventional idea of death comforting and even desirable. Second, this is an analogy to how it feels like to exist in this miserable fucking existence, as consciousness ruins it all. I add the part on not being able to breath, because this is how I would describe my mental atmosphere. Being conscious of my thoughts and situation is fucking insufferable, and internally it feels like I am suffocating on an abstract mental level, and there is nothing I can do about it. Its like have an extreme sunburn on your entire body, and every single position and movement is unbearable, another analogy to how I would describe being conscious. 

If i'm not aware of my thoughts or situation, then I am left with nothing whatsoever, because all forms of joy, interest, pleasure, and emotions are absent, and thus I left with an empty shell of myself that simply exists and has consciousness of this void of nothingness. I must be conscious every single day for hours, days, weeks, months, years, and still decades, when I can barely go through a day being conscious without wanting to fucking die. It is no wonder to me now why people abuse drugs, because they are a means of transforming consciousness into some other form that isn't the one we normally have. Conscious existence is a curse, the only thing I want is sleep, because that is when I am absent of consciousness. I wish that when I went to sleep I would never wake up, and would just experience occasional pleasant dreams with no full form of awareness forever. Maybe If I had something that I truly gave me enjoyment, I would be able to bear this painful existence. But alas, this cannot be, nothing is interesting or brings me joy. I recognize that everything serves as either a vain attempt to feel something, or simply as a distraction from consciousness. Perhaps I have a severe lack of dopamine, and am left to exist closer in line to an oyster thats aware then a well functioning human being. I could keep going, the point it, I fucking hate being aware of existence, because the simply act of being conscious instills suffering and becomes unbearable, and I just wanna fucking kill myself to end it."
1731,depression,Don't you fucking dare give me that philosophical shit in the comments.,"I see a lot of people here asking one common question which is - WHY ME. Why do I have to face all the bad luck while others lead a happy life. 

The answer is very simple if you're willing to understand - FUCK PEOPLE. IT HAS TO BE YOU OVER ANYONE ELSE (INCLUDING YOUR PARENTS). please stop living your life as per societal norms and some karmic shit. 

If someone does bad to you, reciprocate even harder so that they know who they messed with. 
If someone does good to you, good for you. Don't carry this baggage that you've to be nice to them for the rest of your life. 

Start fucking with emotions, your own and of people around you. The moment you stop giving a fuck about what your heart wants you'll be at peace. TRUST ME. 

Be practical. Let this be a give and take thing. Start seeing people and relationships as one time fixed contracts. When you're done with them, leave. Stop giving fucks about how they would feel and shit like that. Start using people if you want to be happy. You're not here to be a spiritual guide lmao. 

Start living your life and fucking with people's lives."

1734,depression,"A problem that lead me to attempt suicide twice is kinda getting resolved. But during it, I was thinking about my old friends, and now I am absolutely dead inside waiting if they will answer my messages. (You will die of old age reading this)","As you saw from the title, this is going to be mega long. 

I moved into this brand new building in early october last year, and I have been trying to get fiber (or some kind of permanent connection) ever since.

I am 100% a loner. I am on my computer, I sleep, I eat, I work (part-time), and sometimes I go out to do the groceries.

As I am writing this I seriously think I should stop. I feel so stupid.

So internet. What I did not know at the time was that there wasn't any when I moved in.
That lead to some very confused calls from me to my current (at the time) Internet provider, the main Internet company (my isp is subsodiary or some shit, cannot explain in english), and the costumer service for the company that owns my building.

That person at my isp was telling me this, this other person was telling me that, etc, etc, until I got a call from a superior. She said that I had to do a thing that did not make any sense (sorry, that was so long ago) with the main company. But I told her they told me that I had to pay for that. Kinda like 2 subcribtions. She said you did not have to pay, I answered that they said I had. And so forth.

So I had enough and said ""just delete my contract, I cannot take this anymore"".

Oh my god you guys are actually going to die if I say everything, just don't read it. 

The only internet I had was on my phone, and I was wondering wtf to do.

So my friend (haven't talked to him since) said that I should make a contract with the company that he uses. They could provide me with a 4g box, and wait until real internet arrives. 

With chance, they have a shop right there. I make a contract for my 4g box (that fact is what almost killed me), went back home, plugged it in, and poof I had internet. I had a limit of 100go per month, so I quicly upgraded it to 200. 

The amount to delete the contract increased as well.

But who cares? I was going to get a permanent connexion soon!

So I called the costumer service and asked to make a fiber contract. They said that they could not do it over the phone and I had to go to a boutique.
But it was right there.
Right there the guy said that he could not make fiber contracts from his shop, that I had to go to one of the 2 malls.

This is probably one of the main raison they made me insane. Almost everything is a pain to do with them.

So I walked my ass to the bus station and went to the mall.

Part of the process to make the contract is that they show you a google map kinda thing, and you point your location. 

Before you ask, I have not make a mistake on the location.

Oh my, it said that adsl AND fiber were available!
So of course I chose fiber and got a appointement pretty soon. 

On my day off, perfect. The schedule said 12-16h, but he was here at 8. Even more perfect! 

After a few minutes, he said ""I do not have the right tools, another technician will contact you today"". And he left.
So I called CS (costumer service) to ask them wtf. CS called the technician who told them that he could not install anything because of the rain. 

Mmmm.

So the next day, I called cs again who called the guy again who FINALLY said that the reason he could not install the fiber was because there was no fiber in the building.

I lost, what, 2 days, because of this guy's bs?

So that was back to the bus to the mall for me.

Make an adsl contract. Another appointement very soon. Too suspicious. But wtf did you wanted me to say. I wasn't broken enough back then.

So the technician arrived, and a few minutes later told me that he could not install adsl because there was no adsl in the building.

But he at least had the decency to tell me right away, and even explain to me a few things.
The isp I was with before and the main isp I mentionned a few times have priority on the cables, or the isp I am with now had the get autorization.

Bottom of the line : no matter what happens, my isp would get internet access later than the first 2 isp.

Technician then left. I called cs and we talked about the fact that there was no adsl in the building, and probably would never be, because it would be a waste of money. 

So we talked about adsl, for a while, right?

The next day I got an email saying that my FIBER contract was deleted and there was no way to revert it.

So what happens when there is no adsl? We delete the fiber contract. Yes.

You guys must be dead, right now.

So since nobody could give me a straigt answer at the begining, exept for the technician, I had to call a higher up at my building's company (brother's old classmate) who did some work for me. 

Internet would arrive around valentine's day.

My appointement with the adsl technician was on dec 3. 

I waited patiently. 

Luckuly a commercial (a guy that comes to your house to make contracts) had left his card for the building, and feb 24, my fiber contract was made with an appointement for march 4.

With all the bs that happened to me and the meds that I have to take, now, I have trouble remembering certain things. Like when my sick leave is ending. I swear to god I wrote it down somewhere. I'll just have to go to work to ask.

Anyway. Will never forget march 4. 

The technician arrived. And he stayed longer than the others! 

Nope. A moment later he told me that he could not install the fiber because there was an error in the adress. Like they ordered fiber for somewhere else.

He stayed a while, on the phone with various people, while I was just sitting on my chair, dead inside.

They called me the next day or some shit to try to locate the building (""is there a parking lot on the left"" or some shit), I did not want to make a mistake (I am always like that) so I refused to answer the question. They then asked me if the main company had left a sign with numbers on it. It would indicate perfectly the building. 

I put some fucking clothes on and looked everywhere. Nothing. 

So I demanded that they send a technician or some shit, that would do technician things and say exacly what building it is. He came here. Twice, even. 

He now knew exactly the location, the complicated numbers, all that shit. So he made a report.

But now I had to wait for my order to be completed. The way it works, I think, the main compagny places an order for a certain place to a computer. And then we have to wait. There is no way to know how long the order will take.

This is when it started to get very very annoying.

To call the service that takes care of my stuff, I have to :

-Call the number
-Push *
-Push 1
-Push any phone number in their database that was not deleted, because it does not matter
-Push any number to join any service
-Say the actual phone number you are calling about
-Say your first name
-Say your last name
-Say your date of birth
-Say your adress
-Wait until the person introduces themselves
-Say that you want to join the fiber activation section
-Give a clear reason why 
-NEVER say that you are not at home, even for an update on your order (""yes your order is complete"" ""no your order is not complete""), because they will refuse to talk with you. I had to call again.
-Hope that the call doesn't end abruptly 

Because there are a LOT of services that you cannot join directly. Or some that you cannot AT ALL.

I would call all the time because I had nothing better to do or because I was upset.

So even with the bs with my last appointement (the 3rd), when my order was completed, they could not give me an earlier appointement.

I had an appointement for april 19th. So march 4th to april 19th.

Meanwhile I'm paying 75‚Ç¨ for 200go a month.

Few days before the appointement, I called a few times so that they check that the main company made the order with the numbers in the rapport the guy made.

Guess what happened on the 19th. Exactly the same thing. Exactly the same error. Even though the game came twice. Even though I called them to tell them to check the order.

Oh, and it was even the same technician. He was also very upset that he was put in the same situation twice.

While he was on the phone, I thought about taking my chair to help me jump off.

I was wondering how much I could take. How many technicians, how many phone calls, how many days for an order.

This time, I was more upset because I was suppose to be on my paid time off, april 23 to 29. I was really counting on my fiber, and you know, not mega stressed and angry.

You guys aren't reading anymore, I think.

So you know what I did during that time off? 

I called almost every day to tell them that they ruined my vacation, and that they should have listenned to me (when I said to check the order before the 19th), and that they had commited the same mistake twice in a row)

At that time, all the guys at the service knew me. 

Meanwhile all this bs, the service, and one of the superiors is actually working with the main company (because I guess the 2 other times they weren't????), so that the main company can make the order with the numbers provided by the rapport of the other guy.

And the order waiting started.

But at the same time, the stress was affecting my body too. I have not had my period for 2 months, and then I started to have bad period pain, but barely anything was coming out

So on may 7 I went to the doctor for some pain medicine.
After that, it started bleeding a lot. On may 12, I went back for something that would slow the bleeding (did not help at all).
On the 17 and the 19th (because the med melted because I did not realized it was that hot in my appartement) I went back for a minor problem that was fixed in 2 days.

Meanwhile, OF COURSE, other bs happened. On april 27 maybe, I got a call from their satisfaction service. He wanted to know my experience with a certain phone call. 

At this point, I was at at least 90 phone calls with them (not counting the times they called me). So I told him to leave me alone, something negative about the company, I had to go in the elevator. He said ""since you don't remember, I will call back"".

Someone called from their number, on the 28, but I guess that person's phone had a problem, because I would pick up, and it would immediatly hung up.

He called again on the 30th. Then the 5th may. Then the 7th may.

At this point I think I already called to complain about him (them, honestly, don't know who that fucker is). They cannot find him because he doesn't leave any traces on my file.

Since this bs started I keep my phone on, in case they call to tell me that my order is done and that I am free from their bs.

But with my health problems, I was in sick leave, and sleeping on a weekday. He called twice.

That time, I was not very upset.

But that night, I barely slept, because I felt so unconfortable because of the period blood and have to get up almost every hour to pee blood in the shower and get a thick thing of blood (don't know what it is called in english).

So I was sleeping again in the morning. When he called. At 10.35, 10.40, 11.17, 11.44, 11.45, 12.34 and 13.59.

I called cs to beg them to find him and tell him to stop. 

For those months there was a few crying. But when I was begging cs, I said ""I did not diserved this"". And  could not stop crying. 

I hung up and found an help hotline. They were able to calm down.

At that moment, I went from whatever the fuck I was to depressive. 

The next day, the 19th, I went to the doctor for some refill on the pain medicine and some antidepressants.

So I'm sorry, like I said, with all this bs, and the meds, I forget stuff. I had to get up to check a business card.

Yes, the business card that led me to the 4th march appointement.

Now I remember why I tried to commit suicide the first time.

Between this bs, they told me my order had failed. And said that by deleting the fiber contract and creating a new one, with the same informations, it would magically solve all the problems. 

They said that the same guy that made my contract would come on the 21. 

So the 21 arrives and I realize that they said many times the date, but not the time. I am extremelly tired, and I have to know if I can sleep a bit or just wait. I missed calls during this bs because I was too tired. So I had to know.

I call him. I rings a few times, then hungs up. I call a few more times. Same thing happens.
It is extremmely suspicious. Because when I called him months ago, it would ring a few times, then I would hear the message thing.

I called again and again, and finally it rang once and hung up. 

He was ignoring me.

I called cs and told them to call him, because I knew he would not decline a call from them. Apparently, something came up and he could not come.

Then I begged them to just send another commercial, that it's not complicated.
They told me that I had to go in the boutique. I said not. I am not going. It is not complicated. Then they said they had to give my file to the directors so that they could make a decision.

All the bs, all the tiredness, 3 months of torture. While they were on the phone saying their bs, I took one of my cheap razors and started braking it.

I did not know what I wanted when I started doing it. So I ended up only making superficial cuts. 

A few days before that, I was given the email for cs, so I wrote long emails about the torture, and the guy that was calling me, and other incompetances.

But that day, I took a picture right after I did it, and sent it with a ""I hope you are happy"".

I called the emmergency, put a few things in a bag (in case they wanted me to stay in emergench psychiatry) and waited on the first floor, on the stairs.

They had to call me (important for later), because it is a new building, they needes directions. But you know, like I said. Superficial cuts, was waiting downstairs. I was chill. 

I sent another picture, with doctors in the background, asked some questions, like ""if the order fails, or the technician cannot install the fiber, in how many years will I have it"" with a the end ""I'm adding another picture so that you don't forget me"".

I was surprised that I was able to go back home that same day.

In the emergency room, the psychiatrist gave me a pill, and when I was home, the only thing I wanted to do was sleep.
The next day I went to the doctor and begged him to call the emergency so that he could prescribe me those pills. So that I would not have to wait in mental pain. That was the 22th that I was given this prescription.

The 24th, it was around noon, and I cannot tell you if I was awake or not. But I was talking to my dear friend. I woke up, took my phone, and realized I did not have his number. But I had my other dearest friend's. But that number is almost 10 years old. So no luck.

I told myself ""I have to find the dvd"". One of those 2 friends and 1 female friend went to france to celebrate 1 other friend's 18th birthday.
But I had lost it in years. I thought I acidentally threw it away.

So for the first time that I actually needed it, I asked myself ""where would I put it?""

-it was given to me in a paper enveloppe : too fragile
-I do not own empty plastic boxes
-cardboard sleeves (demo cds) do not have enough space
-I am not getting rid of any cds

And it was in the first plastic box that I hopenned, I swear.

It was a dumb treasure hunt, 18 gifts. 

But it brought back so many memories. We are all internet friends, btw. We would play this free mmo, but we would be all the time on the forum, having fun and what not.

I was elected ""bouffon de la cour"", because I was bringing life to the non gaming section of the forum.
I wanted my friends back. I wanted my sanity back. I wanted to take my dvd with me and jump with it.

I put the dvd in my favorite album, took my phone, took my chair, and headed to the last floor.

It was locked, so I headed downstairs. I sat on my chair, because I knew it would hurt very much if I jumped, and called the emmergencies. 

The person convinced me to get back to my appartement, where I prepared a more serious bag with me (still kept my album) and headed downstairs, again. 

I spent the night in the psychiatry emmergencies. I was the only one.
I have a very bad memory from the day crew, when I left. The psychiatrist was the same from the emmergency room on the 21th, and the only thing he did to help was giving me my pill.

So the 25th, i was still desperate. I sneaked out to the emergy room. One person asked me who I was, and I started running to find something to hurt me.

The emergency staff (not the psychiatry one) held me, sat me down and said stuff like ""the psychiatry staff will talk to you"".

No one talked to me. Execpt the security guard, who told me I needed to find somewhere else to sit down because he wanted to write something.

I sat down in my assigned bed and kept the exact same position for more than 1h30min. I heard them order me a taxi to go home, heard them talk about their lives and stuff, laugh, and someone noticed my car wasn't there yet. Then it arrived and this nurse said, in a normal friendly voice, ""goodbye, madame Edc"". 

I looked her in the eye and said ""you know exactly what is going to happen next time.""

So it was still the 25th, and you are probably more dead than me at this point.

So the 25th, I still want to die, but I want to call someone. The psychologue that I saw during my time in a clinic en 2019.

She calmed me down.

So the 26. God, the 26. I completely forgot about that but it is a little mixed up. On the 21, my appointement with the commercial was moved to the 26. I am following my calls on my phone, at this point.

Commercial still ignoring me. I had enough.

This is where I have to tell you the fondation of this nightmare. The 4g box is my first contract. The others have never been activated, so they are all worth 0‚Ç¨. If I want to leave, I have to pay a fee (it's like between 400 and 600‚Ç¨) because I have an engagement for the 4g box.

They could delete everything. If I had problems. With the 4g box. Even with everything that happened, they don't give a shit and rather make me completely crazy, or dead.

I know this because I had asked multiple times.

But this time, the thought of waiting again, for something that is probably not going to work, the thought of a technician arriving and leaving right after, the thought of my sanity gone.

The razor blade was still there, next to the bed. While this person was talking about giving my file to a director, I took it and cut as long as I could. I kept cutting while that person was still on the phone while screaming in pain and saying ""everything is your fault"". I immediatly took 2 pictures and sent them to cs saying again ""I hope you are happy"".

I can't remember if I made my bag before or after. But anyway, this time, I had to wait the emmergencies in the house. There were drops of blood in a lot of places. The funny thing is that my bed barely felt the difference, with the period blood.

Jesus Christ I am getting bored of my own story.

So in the house they made a bandage thing (sorry, no medical knowledge), but my leg had still blood on it. While waiting in the emmergency room a fly was being very annoying.

I got 19 sutures. Or the doctor counted 19 while looking at every thread. The anesthenic needle hurts, but the sutures don't.
The main doctor visited me and I begged him that I see a psychiatrist, because I could not trust the others.

He helped me quite a lot.
And the next day, the psychiatrist, that I never met helped me out too. He said that I had to choose a nurse because my wounds require caring.

The day before, right after I arrived at the emmergency, my phone rang. It was a commercial. They apparently found one. But I was in the middle of suffering, so I said something mean and hung up.

So the next day I called him back, appologized, and he gave me an appointement for the next day, the 28th!
Good news, but how long and how many times the process was goinc to fail? 

The 28th, I first called the nurse to confirm our appointement. Then I did the same with the new commercial.

He said. He could not come because the directors do not want commercials sent to my house. 

I was so close. All he had to do was get there, and make the contract. I was going to get the contract, and legit not call them. Let them call me when the order or whatever would or not be ready.

I broke in tears, and called the nurse to cancel our appointement.

I took my album, my phone, my chair, and went up.

Execpt this time, I did not sat on the chair. I sat on the stairs. I called the commercial, who ignored me. I cannot remember whag cs said. Then I receive a call from the emmergencies. The nurse called them. Like always, they pass me the call to a doctor. 

I was still broken. She said things like ""we sent the emmergencies for you multiple times right?"".
She would not understand what I was saying.

How the fuck how I suppose to explain all of this in like 5 minutes? 

She said she would send an ambulance, and hung up, I think. I went back to my house to make another bag. 

Called the commercial, because I wanted a reason for this bs, tried to call my old psy, again, but she already left work, called a help hotline, called the commercial again, then cs for 25min. No idea what I talked about.

Noticed something strange? No ambulance.
That fucking bitch could have killed me.

So I called the nurse again so he could come back. I went to the store close to my house. To beg if they could make a contract for me. Apparently they have the materiel now, but it was close to closing and the necessary guy had left already. Apparently I finished the day with a 25min call to cs. No idea. Don't ask me.

On the 29th. 3 am. Could not sleep. Saw an email. Could not sleep anymore. They deleted my contrat for my 4g box and I had to pay 400‚Ç¨. At one point the net stopped working. They had deleted it. Had to wait until 6am (out of all the bs, thank god cs opens at 6) to sort this out.

So because they are incompetants, they misinspreted what I said and started the process of deleting. But I sent a ""wtf is wrong with you I never said this"" and they were like ""ah ok sorry"". But they didn't cancel the deleting.

Because the directors or whatever, I went back to the shop because maybe the guy would be there and I also forgot everything else the other guy said.
I asked ""do you make fiber contracts"" ""yes, what adress"" ""that adress"" ""na they don't have it here"" ""wwwwhat"" ""listen, I live there, I know. Let me call J. Hey J, there is this lady here, here is her number"" (this is a very dumbed down version of the conversation).

So J calls me right away and gives me an appointement for this afternoon. I'm confused, because I have no idea what his job his. 

So basically J hooked me up with the isp I was with before, because cunt company knew they didn't had access to the fiber and was going to make me turn in circles until I litteraly die.

But those cunts did it again with the ""the client said not to delete"", and the other guy was probably wearing his headphones or something.
I have a bill for 233‚Ç¨, the lady said not to worry about it, but I screamed at her to tell the service to make a new bill. Because, of course they fucking forgot, because they are cunts : they owe me money. I'll call again to remind them.

Like, fuck me, I wasn't going to call them again and they start their bs. 

And you know what ? My period finally stopped. Guess when.

Those motherfucking cunts almost killed me.

But to come back to the title. I have this friend I know is on steam, but he hasn't been on for a few days.

And this other friend. Holy fucking shit. I made a facebook and Instagram account to find him and contact him. But those accounts are too old.
Then I was like ""what is a popul... twitter"". I think I found him. His account is private but I saw that someone answered to him in sept 2020. 

God, I feel so empty, I just want this cunt company to die and me having what I've been fighting all along for. Fucking fiber.

And talk a little to my friends. Just a little.

So if you are insane like me and read everything : I sent the photos and kinda (really) harassed them because I want them to remember until they die that it is their fault. They made me go fucking crazy. I never harmed myself before, or took a chair as high as I could.

I have no idea if I can come back from this. 

Dude, like every time I have a real conversarion like this, nobody answers.

And the fucking keyboard on this phone, I swear to god.

And another thing that PISSES me off : the psychiatrists have appointements until like july or some shit. And psychologists are not riembursed.

Alright, bye to myself, looks like I have to wait until 6am again, if I do not see that bill fixed I'll be super stressed again."

I'm 45 man from Egypt, software developer. 5 years ago, I met a nice lady from Lithuania (an EU country) and I moved there, married her and found a job there. Later, she divorced me and I cannot keep a job for more than a year. Three places fired me after a year in each because I was not good enough as they expected. I think I'm not good enough yes, I'm from a third world country, old and I cannot be good like young European developers.

Now, I have no family, no friends and soon I will have no job. That divorce I had was my second one and I don't want to look for another job because I will end up with the same result, being fired again. I don't want get back to Egypt either, I have no one there and there is no future in that country. I think I have no friends here because people are afraid of someone like me from the middle east.

I'm old and I have been living with my cats only for more than a year. I'm thinking about killing myself but because I'm a 100% loser, I'm extremely worried to fail and to have a permanent disability to live with. I called the suicide hotline but they kept me waiting and ended the call later.

1742,depression,Has my boyfriend stopped taking antidepressants so he can game more?,"My boyfriend used to take his antidepressant pill once a day, he told me he‚Äôs been on antidepressants since his teens (he‚Äôs now 27).

First it was weight gain (he complained about it to me, I told him I didn‚Äôt care as long as he‚Äôs happy but if he‚Äôs really worried he should just do a bit more movement like go on walks. Next was a doctors trip, his vitamin d levels are insufficient so the doctor recommended he go outside. And thirdly was the antidepressants, he hasn‚Äôt picked up a new prescription for 2 months! I keep asking him and he tells me he will but he just hasn‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm worried he‚Äôs getting his dopamine release from staying on the computer, and he‚Äôs not even always gaming sometimes he just browsed random things on google. 

It‚Äôs getting excessive, he isn‚Äôt taking care of himself anymore, he wakes up to game (I woke up at 8am today to see that he had already started gaming) and plays until it‚Äôs time to go to sleep. 

I‚Äôm posting in the depression subreddit because if this is an issue with his mental health then I want to try to help him. 

It‚Äôs also one thing to note that when I do bring up outdoor activities he calls me controlling, when I bring up excessive computer time he says I‚Äôm using it as a scapegoat for our other problems.

Although it was rational, I did not really think things through, because many months have passed since I cut myself, and yet, the scars are very visible. I stopped wearing T-shirts because of this, and I never take my shirt off if someone is near. I can't go to a pool, I can't go to the beach, because of the scars. I am afraid that someone might see them, and I will be judged. I did not think that I cut so deep as to leave visible scars.

How do you explain this to another person, if discovered? How can they understand? Mental health is a touchy subject, even taboo in some geographical areas. Is it better to keep it all in yourself, or get out there and risk being misunderstood or judged?

I stopped cutting myself a long time ago. A small victory, but still a victory.

Anyone feel me?"
1744,depression,I want to kill myself even though I am at the happiest point in my life.,"  

I have been a chronically depressed and self-harming for the past 5-6 years of my life (I can‚Äôt really remember what it feels like to be happy anymore). I just remember existing in a void of space, patiently waiting for my end. What came next, I did not expect. 

Three years ago, I used to be a teacher assistant for one of my community college classes and about 4 months ago, one of the students from that class got back to me online, we started talking, she confessed her feelings for me and now, we have been dating for almost two months. It would be a disgraceful lie to say that these past few months did not bring me the biggest joy in my life. I question every day, why someone like her would ever want to be with someone like me. She is incredibly smart, kind, patient, forgiving, and just outworldly gorgeous. When we just started talking and she confessed her feelings for me, I did my utmost best to explain to her my mental health situation, because I knew that I would end up falling for her and eventually I will become a burden for her. This is exactly what happened, unfortunately. 

I fell for her even harder that I expected. Not only because she is my first girlfriend, but also because of how much I admire her as an individual. But sometimes, this only makes things worse. Nowadays, I spend most of my days contemplating my insecurities and just being stuck in my head, imagining ridiculous scenarios of how she will eventually dump me because of myriad of reasons: my jealousy of her past, my insecurities about my personality, etc. I glob as many relationships advice videos as I can to find tips on how to handle my insecurities, my depression and suicidal thoughts, and not bother her with my mental health issues all the time, but whenever I seek her help, she is always incredibly supportive and helps me to go through my emotions. However, I feel like she is getting tired of having to comfort me all the time and assuring me of her feelings to me. 

On one hand, I am being pushed forward by my wonderful girlfriend, who I do not deserve, but who I love and care for, with all my heart. On the other hand, I am being pulled back by my past, my insecurities about her past and myself, the thoughts of making her a favor and taking my life. Some days, my love for her gets me through the day easily. Other days, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about ending it all for her sake, because I don‚Äôt want to hold her down as an individual. 

Today, I was driving on a highway and for no reason, I went to a left lane and sped up to 85 mph. For a second, I was hoping I would get crashed and die in an accident, but then quickly regrouped myself mentally. 

I am sorry for long post, but I just needed a space to share."
1745,depression,part of me wishes i didnt have friends so i would stop comparing myself to them,"they have family that cares and understands them, they live in a developed country where all their needs are met, they are happy with what they have, they are not suffering from an illness. i envy them so much because they have it so much better than me. i just wish i wasnt born to an abusive parents in a third world country where its impossible for me to get proper healthcare."
1746,depression,Life,I've gotten to the point where I don't know what to feel anymore which is mostly psychologically.. over the years I feel that I've numbed even more than I used to be. I have no interest in almost everything but somehow still manage to force myself to do things. I suppose this is more of a desire than motivation. I still struggle to not reject any form of happiness. It's really scary out there and nobody can prepare you for it. All you can really do is learn and try your best to not repeat the same mistakes.

1750,depression,Even before the sudden loss of my mom I felt disgusted by this world and how cruel it is. I‚Äôm not cut out for it.,"Some of you may remember me from the post I made here when my mother died and I got such great encouragement and support and I cannot thank you all enough for that, but here I am again possibly worse off than before. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on currently.


For along time now I have been experiencing what I think is an existential crisis due to the ugly state of the world in particular the USA. Whether it‚Äôs the government being corrupt top to bottom, whether left or right, from grassroots local govt all the way up to the president. The racial tension, toddlers being taken from their bed and killed, Covid 19 and the great mask debate, I just loath a lot of, if not most of humanity. So much so I slipped into a deep depression and became completely isolated. Just completely sick of it all.

And then around two weeks ago I lost my only family, my mother, suddenly to cancer and wasn‚Äôt able to see her before she passed. Besides my young daughter she was all I had, we are a poor family‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a single dad of a beautiful little girl whose mother bailed on her when she was 2 and not so much as a birthday card or phone call since. Because I was the only relative I had Drive six hours two have her body cremated because it was all I could afford and even that drained my savings and I had to open up multiple credit cards just to cover it all. I don‚Äôt care about the money I just wish so badly that my daughter and I could have spent some time with her before she passed. 

In the weeks following I feel I have out of body experiences, more like it‚Äôs not real‚Ä¶ Like I am living in my own personal hell where one thing after another goes terribly wrong. My daughter is becoming a young lady and all that goes with that and I have no female mother figure for her to talk to about these things, i‚Äôve checked out books from the library and scoured the Internet and giving her the best advice I can. But it‚Äôs not the same.

Even though we lived six hours away my mother and my daughter were very close, and my daughter has taken her passing very hard which is to be expected, I‚Äôve tried my best to keep a strong face and help her through it but it hasn‚Äôt been all that effective. 

Shortly before my mother passed a stray kitten wandered onto our porch and immediately bonded with my daughter like I had never seen before, wouldn‚Äôt leave her side, slept in her bed, played with her outside‚Ä¶ It has been so nice and cathartic to see her so happy with ‚Äúchonkers‚Äù her cat.

Well wouldn‚Äôt you know it, as my personal hell would have it‚Ä¶ The cat has become ill. I had planned on saving some money and paying down some credit cards so that I could take the cat to get its shots and have it fixed, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to make it that long‚Ä¶ From what I‚Äôm reading about the symptoms it‚Äôs most likely a parasite but I cannot find a vet who is willing to treat it and bill me as opposed to money up front. No sliding scale vets, and the university veterinarian hospital that treats for free sometimes has a waiting list months long.

The only reason I I‚Äôm writing about that part of it is because watching her happiness was is keeping me going. Now watching her cry because of the condition her cat is in and knowing it‚Äôs dying it‚Äôs just tearing me apart. I haven‚Äôt had any suicidal thoughts, I‚Äôm just exhausted and have nothing left in the tank to fight the depression and I‚Äôm just very scared I‚Äôm going to be stuck in this dark hole forever. 

I miss my mom so much, I lost my dad years back and I miss him so much too. These are the people that have always been there for me and my times of despair and now they‚Äôre gone. I called my local crisis line and they are putting me in touch with some counselors who work pro bono but the wait is very long which I‚Äôm assuming is due to a very large percentage of the nation dealing with depression because of Covid and a litany of other things. 

It helps me to get this stuff off my chest and I suppose that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm posting‚Ä¶ I am not a thoughts and prayers kind of guy but please send positive energy to my daughter and her cat I hope so much he is able to pull through or that I can finds vet willing to work with me and my current situation. 

TLDR; I have been dealing with an existential crisis and depression for about a year, it was progressively getting worse and then my mother died suddenly of cancer a couple of weeks ago. I traveled to have her cremated and try to get back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äú life to keep our heads above water, our lights on, and food in our bellies. My daughters stray cat who is her best friend has become ill and there‚Äôs nothing I can do for it, watching her watch it die is killing me. Just looking for some love and support

Thanks"
1751,depression,I don‚Äôt feel normal anymore. Can‚Äôt tell if this is some kind of depression...,"Hi guys, 19 year old hypochondriac here. I feel like I‚Äôm slowly losing myself honestly. I‚Äôll start off on a whim saying that nothing feels normal, everything has changed. I think this is due to the combination of changes in my life, health anxiety, smoking weed, and looking at everything in a new perspective. This ‚Äúnew perspective‚Äù is absolutely destroying me. I‚Äôm constantly thinking about death and not existing (not like suicidal thoughts AT ALL. Just like a fear of death per se). I‚Äôm really worried that I‚Äôm on the brink of losing my mind. My first plan of action is to lay off on the weed, then find a therapist for this shit. I feel like this is a common mid-life thing that college kids go through but I don‚Äôt know how to label it. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm disassociating or anything, I really just feel like I‚Äôm looking at everything in this new perspective and I don‚Äôt feel like my normal self anymore. I still enjoy doing things like riding my bike, making and playing music, playing video games, etc. But I feel like I‚Äôm counting the days down now and not making the days count. I dunno. It‚Äôs so hard to explain. Nothing is the same like it used to be, but not in a bad way I guess. Do any of you guys sort of relate? You just miss how you used to feel before?"

I'm less motivated now even to continue with my hobbies that I have been so consistent with over the last year. My only hope is that this terrible feeling will pass and I can get back to my normal self. Does anyone have similar experiences?"

But I still get lonely. I'm always by myself, I have no one and sometimes I just want to be touched, hugged, to lay next to someone. 

I'm pretty sure I'm asexual or close enough as makes no difference. But I still want *some* kind of intimacy. 

I haven't been hugged in months, I haven't kissed someone in at least 2 years. I haven't shared a bed with someone in 2 years. 5 years before that brief intimacy hiatus.

1770,depression,"My friend is depressed, has inferiority complex, hates himself for being weak and doesn't ""want"" to change and seek therapy.","Hello everyone. 

We live in Iran; so there's that.

It's been almost five years that a friend of mine suffers from depression. I think it first started when he fell in love with a girl who never really cared about him, wasted two years of his life on her and when he moved on, he was faced with a huge university entrance exam and since he hadn't studied much, he didn't do good and got low scores, decided to wait one more year so he could give that soul-crushing exam one more time (yes, it crushes students in Iran, since studying Medicine is the only way to guarantee a well-paid life in this country; other jobs can't really pay off) and this time he intended to be more prepared; but again, he couldn't make it.

So to avoid mandatory military draft, he had no choice but to go for a low-ranked major. So he's been a university-student for two years now.

Again, he fell in love with a girl in their class; they got friends, he really didn't express his love for her, she got into a relationship with another guy(who was a total ass), some stuff happend afterwards and my friend just cut off any connections with the girl.

It send him into the deeper depths of depression and he was coming up with sentences like ""I'm just a fucked-up guy, life always intends to fuck me up, it's the way of life for me and there's nothing I can do, I was born to be fucked, I'm meant to suffer"" and questions like ""why me? Why should all this shit happen to me?"".

After about eight months or so, she broke up with that guy, befriended my friend again, they got close and eventually he confessed his love for her, but she rejected; she's planning on migrating to Germany within a year. So she doesn't wish to form a love bond with someone at the moment, for it'll make the soon-to-come departure harder.

They still talk, they're still friends, they fight over trivial crap like little children. But the main problem he's facing rn, is that deeply believes himself to be a ""weak sick impotent mind"". He can't even maintain a daily routine for just a week. He sometimes has short periods of beneficial activies due to my motivational speeches, but then relapses again. And he believes that therapy does not work and those who have survived depression through therapy, are ""delusional, they just 'think' that they've gone better"".

What can I do to convince him to visit a therapist?"

The abyss is starring at me and eventually I‚Äôll go inside of it but I don‚Äôt want it to be anytime soon god please why were any of us BORN there has to be a reason why I suffer why why did you put me here? 

It‚Äôs so hard to fucking sleep at night then I wake up early in the morning don‚Äôt sleep well it becomes 1-2pm I finally get in the mood to sleep but can‚Äôt.

Death isn‚Äôt a answer I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs after death and it‚Äôs too risky to try to suicide and what if I fail and everything is worse....????? Maybe a hero will shoot me to death?? 

But tomorrow I‚Äôll be ok again and thinking about dumb stuff that doesn‚Äôt matter. This is the truth. That‚Äôs not bad though as ignorance is bliss. No matter what being ignorant is better than having the knowledge. I say god help me because I have no one and even if I did they wouldn‚Äôt understand me and even if I did have someone who understood me then what???? That wouldn‚Äôt fit in the tut reality.

1772,depression,Trying to say goodbye to a suicidal friend,"I'm writing this with a heavy heart. 

I know him since not long ago, but we became very close in the last few weeks. He's such a good person, loves animals and climbing. I feel so calm and confortable when I'm with him.

Since day 1 he told me he has suicidal thoughts. Not every every once in a while, but multiple times a day. He already did therapy and is in medication, the strongest there is. I understand, I also take medication for anxiety disorder and helped me a lot. But in his case, these thoughts are still there.

Yesterday after we when climbing together I asked him what still holds him here, in this life. He has been through a lot, has a child, is studying, has money, friends that love him. I thought we was going to say something, maybe he still wanted to wait to finish a book, or the thought of his son growing up, or maybe keep pushing himself to climb a harder path, or see me again or anyone again. 

He said he doesn't know, that he already tried but didn't find that time and thing that killed him finally. That he will probably eventually do it, that it's matter of time. 

I try to understand, but I really just want to hold his hand and show him everything that excites me, with the hope he grabs onto something, anything. 

I feel like such a bad friend, how can I be so egoistic to think I can save him from his suffering. I'm having such a hard time trying to wrap my head around his possible suicide and his now suffering. 

I'm going to tell him it's ok. That I will try not to be mad or sad if he does it. That I will try to understand. That he's not being selfish. That I will remember him. That we all love him. That he tried. 

Thank you for reading, take care."

I have no real easily identifiable reason to feel like I do, things in my life are going fine, studies, friends, family, girlfriend etc. 

I can go a long time feeling fine. But right now, it's worse than ever, I just feel so fucking bad deep inside of me, a part of me would just wish that I could die suddenly and not have to bother anymore. Though I should be clear I'm not thinking of taking my life, don't think I could ever do that. 

I do easily get anxiety and stress about the future (lot's of hopeless- and pointlessness). I guess it's also hard for me because I don't feel like I can talk about this with anybody, at least not in depth. My girlfriend I've told to some extent and I think she can tell (she's very supportive), but I don't want to burden her and I fear bringing her with me down that road. Same goes with friends and family to some extent, I don't want people worrying about me either. 

I don't have any formal diagnosis for anything, never got it looked at either (just went to talk to someone last year of high school). I don't know if I'm depressed, previously I've had problems with eating, sleeping, I have a lack of sense of joy or interest for anything, and once again I'm starting to feel this way, and an overwhelming feeling of sadness, without being able to cry or move on from it.

I've been out of work since December and got a job interview in a couple of hours. Only the landlord upstairs has decided to change the flooring in his flat above mine today. 

Since moving into my flat, every day has been constant noise from loud footsteps to barking dogs to guitar playing to loud conversations.

Due to the noise I've put my flat up for sale but nobody is interested in buying it.

Everyday I live with noise cancelling headphones and earplugs on. I can't relax without alcohol. Even though I've a job interview I am already drinking.

The last date I had, the woman cancelled the dinner, and then went out with her ex instead, without telling me she was going to be late and that we'd no longer be eating together.

The one before that took the condom off without asking me, told me she'd been tested, then changed her story the next day and joked about giving me HIV. When I tell people about this some are sympathetic and other think its funny and my own fault. (I've been tested and thankfully OK)

I've been stuck in my fucking flat for a year now due to pandemic and the isolation is killing me.

It isn't about drugs or crime, just that my depression has made me so disconnected from reality that I feel nothing except anger and very rarely sadness. It hurts to be happy. I feel almost nothing except those two emotions from time to time and the anger one is the strongest out of them.

I'm ashamed to be a fuck up and still successful because I know I shouldn't be depressed. Sometimes it feels like my life is coming to an end and that's very soon. I've been trying to self-harm but the pain isn't what's keeping me from doing it, just the tools that I have available. Keep in mind that this needs to be a secret too, so I can only cut myself on my chest area, or my back."

1782,depression,How do I apologize after lashing out because of a trigger?,"This morning the girl I've been dating sent me a clip of of her in the office trying to shoo away a pregnant trying to nest at her desk, where she said ""If you don't go away I'll kick you!""

Of course she didn't actually mean it, but being out of sorts from sleep deprivation, I reacted adversely and told her along the conversation that hypothetically, I wouldn't want to work with her because I'd probably react much worse if I heard what she said firsthand. She asked if it would be enough to make me break things off, to which I replied, ""I don't know.""

I then proceeded to tell her raw what I felt, which was just disgust--physiological revulsion. That soured the conversation and stopped talks.

This afternoon, she told me that she was put off by what I said, as if such a petty thing as a cat was enough for me to end things. I shared more of what I experienced, which was a triggering of childhood witnessing of animal cruelty, a growing sense of aimlessness and frustration about my life the past few years, and a reminder of how similarly cruel my ex could be. I also told her I was hurt that she thought I could let things go so lightly when I have always told her how much I loved and cared for her and had always lent an ear when I could. Communication broke down, though, as I felt her tone wasn't kind (which of course, is a big ask considering she was also in a bad mood), and I proceeded to just keep screaming ""I'm in the wrong!"" repeatedly.

I want to apologize, I do. And I understand her point that such a small thing (a cat) leading to this situation reflects doubtfulness of how I'd handle other confrontations.

At the moment we've decided to put off talking until we cool our heads.

Have any ideas, anyone? Would greatly appreciate your input."
1783,depression,How to survive college with depression,"Hi guys. 

I‚Äôm currently at college finishing my major.
I‚Äôm an ambitious person by nature and I am somehow surviving this whole college experience but AT WHAT COST. It‚Äôs so tough even though it‚Äôs online, I am literally crying during exams and then I have to sleep till evening because I‚Äôm so tired. I struggle with taking care of myself and my surroundings. I only have couple of good days and that‚Äôs when I want to party and meet people and I am all cheerful - but it lasts short and then I am again in my darkness and stress. I was diagnosed with depression (my psychiatrist was not sure if I am bipolar or not because I‚Äôm still young and he is still diagnosing me).
Any tips for surviving college with depression? I am often close to quitting this fucking thing.

Thank you."

1790,depression,I don‚Äôt understand why my mom gets so angry with me for feeling suicidal and self harming,"It‚Äôs so frustrating. I‚Äôve been dealing with suicidal thoughts and self harming on and off  ever since I was a teenager (I‚Äôm in my mid 20s now). I have NEVER been able to speak with my mother about either of these issues as it always results in a fight. As a teen, any time my mother would see cuts on my body, she would curse at me, call me a psychopath and would accuse me of trying to make her ‚Äúlook like a bad parent.‚Äù It was even worse when I would try to express my suicidal feelings; I would get yelled at for being ‚Äúungrateful‚Äù and for stressing her out. 

 Nothing has changed even now that I‚Äôm an adult. If I bring up any suicidal feelings, I get yelled at and called names, and accused of just wanting attention.  I also have to be very diligent about hiding my self-harm scars so I don‚Äôt anger her, or cause another argument. Fortunately, I have a wonderful therapist and psychiatrist, so I am able to receive help for these problems. 

Sorry for the rant, I just don‚Äôt understand why my problems with depression piss my mother off to such a degree."

1795,depression,I complain about some issues,"I had posted another post on here, and I don't know how to edit that one so I'm making another one to put more of my thoughts about my life and rant a lot. Please ignore everything if you want. 

I think the biggest main issue in my life right now is my mom. I know, stereotypical dumbass teen complains about his mother. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you. I don't actually know what that means, but it felt right to say it. 

I've been given a lot of things by my mom so I should probably shut up and be her slave and do everything I am told already. But I just can't help my think about how much of a pain being in her presence is. I guess I'll start low and work my way up about all the things that she does that makes me feel irritated. 

I don't like how she talks. I mean the tone and manner. It just sounds very fake and insincere. I'd rather her talk slower and quieter. Every time I heard a high pitch sound I always think about my mom. I don't know why, but I am kind of scared of her voice. Maybe if I had to guess, it's because she would always talk about everything I am not very good at and tell me a lot of other things which are probably helpful. I would always focus on when she says my faults because it feels weird hearing someone say that. 

I'd wish she stop talking about my grades. I used to think I was smart until I realized I wasn't, but I think she still wants me to be smart or something. She makes me think grades are very important and a lot of other things which is probably true, but I can't help but feel like she looks down on me. She probably does. One thing I remember her saying very well was that I was a loser. She's probably right but I just don't like when she said that. I think I made this and that other thread today because I was just shown my grade of 89% in a class my mom thought I was good at. Then, I was berated(is that the right word?) and she does what she normally does. 

I don't like it when she acts nice to me. For years, she's been acting nice, then arguing with me. It  makes me cry a lot when she does that so I want her to stop it. So can she just stop being nice to me? I hate it when she compliments me because I feel like it was fake and only there because she felt obligated to do it. 

I feel like blaming everything on her. I always felt bad at things probably because I was/am. But I just want to blame her for it, for always working so late and coming home in the mornings. For not letting me go to the high school all my friends went to and letting go to a new school where I am picked on. I always felt like it was her fault. But I also blame everything on her so I don't have to blame myself. I think I secretly know every bad thing that happened to me was my fault. i think I don't want that to be true. But I think it is becoming true. 

I take back what I said in the beginning of this rant. The main issue I have is myself. And I think I am a very small person for blaming it on others. I was the one who I look down on. i want to stand there and laugh at myself. There's a lot of problems that I could of solved if I was smarter and tried being smarter. 

I guess the only solution to for me to either get smarter or something. I don't really have any motivation to do it. I just want to sleep and do it someday when I feel better. I don't really feel any smarter than I was two or three years ago. I felt just as clueless and I felt like I could be smarter in the future. I don't really know why I haven't just said my problems already, then people would reply solutions or something, I don't know how this site works. 

I always feel like I am very weak. I can't really run well. And I sweat easily. I don't think I am good at any physical activity. When I get the courage to go outside, I always stop and look in the mirror, then decide not to go outside. Then when I try and do something at home, I always feel like my mom will come home and I don't want her to see me as pathetic or something even though she probably does. I guess I tried exercising in my room, but I always just want to find an excuse for me to not do anything so I don't. 

I hate that I am very lazy. I can never study. I can never exercise. Everytime I am home I just want to sleep. I just feel very tired when I am home. I am supposed to go with a friend to a restaurant this Monday but I want to just say no because I don't want him to look at me and see how nothing about me really improved. 

I don't really know why I am complaining so much. I don't want the internet to say that I am a bitch or coward or anything like that but I don't want to include some things I don't want to think about. I actually kinda hope no one sees this so they don't comment on how much of a coward I am. Even though I know this, I still wanted to write this and just see if I really am a bad person or that I am a fine person and I was just overreacting. I feel very bad about writing this much for someone to read. I can't really read that well so I would probably hate whoever made this.  Now that I think about it. I really don't want anyone to read this. Compared to other things in this reddit, my situation is probably very good and I probably sound like a whining spoiled child who made a whole essay because he was sad.  I really want to erase this now and continue to do nothing. I'll probably erase this."

1797,depression,Always had relationship problems,"I‚Äôve never been in a romantic relationship with anybody.  I‚Äôve come close to being in relationships but one of three things always happens: (1) I either mess it up by not acting fast enough because I‚Äôm too scared to make a move, or I‚Äôm just too stupid to realize the girl‚Äôs into me, or (2) the girl I like just doesn‚Äôt like me back, or (3) something completely out of our control stops us from starting anything meaningful.  The third happens way too much and is always soul crushing.  Whenever the stars align and a girl and I end up having some real chemistry, life always ends up getting in the way.  Twice I‚Äôve been talking to a girl, I like her and she clearly likes me, but then she goes to one school and I go to another before anything has time to develop.  Or the summer goes by and we never have a class together ever again.  Or one girl outright moved out of the state before I could do anything.  It sucks so hard.  And whenever I‚Äôm the one to mess it up, I just end up hating myself.  I‚Äôve been alone for my whole life and I‚Äôm sick of it.  My friends all have girlfriends and I look at their relationships and wish I had what they had.  Or I see them having problems and think that I could do so much better as a boyfriend.

(I don't do drugs btw) i have no motivation and I've tried to get into something so I don't have to listen to myself asking who am I ? or what am I ? I'm not suicidal but sometimes I see something sharp and i just imagine harming my self with it or just wishing i would get beaten to a pulp just to feel something. it get hard sometimes keeping up with lies i make for me to feel more important than what i really am. i try to be happy but i just cant keep up with it. its hard for me to type this rn because i just know no one would care, I've excepted that. I've been in a mental hospital after a failed suicide attempt and honestly it was the worst mistake of my life cause now my parents see me differently and every time I have an idea and tell them they make it seem like i wanna kill my self again, it makes me hate my parents. the feeling of just sitting for hours without any stimulation just makes me go mad with insanity, just thoughts rushing in and out not knowing how to make it stop and just trying to find a YouTube video or going for a walk or a drive and it not doing anything. i get bad headaches and body aches just from doing nothing. it sucks.

1808,depression,Working theory is I'm brain-damaged.,"Just some thoughts before I absolutely must put myself to bed.

I wonder if ADHD/Anxiety/depression have changed the way my brain works to an extent I didn't even know was possible.  Effectively, I must be by definition, ""brain damaged"".

I made a few response posts to various threads, trying to convey the totality of my thoughts triggered by those respective threads, and I realized I communicate like someone who has Aspergers, which I am not saying flippantly.  It's just, I grew up in an environment of constant abuse, where we were constantly misunderstanding and gaslighting one another, particularly my dad.  Even us being good to one another was having five hour back porch, musing about life kind of talks.  

My mom is a much, much simpler person.  I always resented her for being kinda dumb. She has like a 7th grade education and is from a literal island. But I've come to a certain awareness that growing up in a constant trauma state has probably affected me so deeply, that ""broken"" might be a pretty apt descriptor.

Even loving who I am, I have also been confronted recently with the idea that just because I learned to love and value myself, doesn't mean I stopped hating myself.  I wouldn't have ever thought those two things could coexist, and yet here I am, feeling how I feel.

I have been fighting so hard as of late.  Fighting to not lose my self love and worth being on top, and I'm losing.

I can barely focus, I sure as shit haven't been sleeping.  And in its most recent example, I realized people must think I'm word-vomiting to sound smart, or feel superior.  Like, no, this nonsense is how my brain works.  I'm lucky I get anything remotely right, so when I feel assured my thinking is sound, I want to express the totality of my thoughts so you know exactly how I got there.  Yeah, it might be a jigsaw puzzle, but I recall lots of conversations when I did have friends in my twenties that were substantive and also all over the place simultaneously.

Is it really all that foreign and burdensome for people to have to work a little harder to understand?  I spend an enormous amount of energy having to check my internal logic, and even then I am forced to be humble and open because there's always a chance I took a hardline stance on a range of issues and got it wrong, or unintentionally hurt someone.  ""Normal"" people have zero interest in putting that much effort into checking their biases, and it's downright insulting.

Yeah, I sermonize, I respond in both text and RL with a river of consciousness.

Ugh... it only draws me back to the idea that I absolutely can't be on this planet for many more years and decades.  If I'm so... unpalatable, weak, stupid, warped, and worst of all, completely alone, then what the fuck am I doing here?  Meditating?  Achieving small dreams like being a functional, whole person, or being clever enough to free myself from class chains? I am no martyr, I have had so many people leave me for valid reasons, even people I would have done literally anything for. But why am I trying so hard to carry myself with dignity and compassion, only to be too soft and dysfunctional to know how other people see me?

I'm so afraid.  Not in any way that matters tonight, but I am losing, and I'm afraid. I'm hurt and alone, and with the exception of a few spread out years, and a few handfuls of people I have cared about, I always have been.  And I am pretty sure it broke me and my brain in a way that can't be helped.

I'm so afraid that the truth is, I have struggled 24/7/365 nearly my entire life to get here, at this point in my healing, and it's all for nothing. I used to tell the story too often, but I remember where I was when I felt something in my universe change.  And because a truth like that, would be pretty iron clad, I wouldn't have much to fight ""brain damaged"" from trauma and physical injuries and a shit family and isolation and, and, and...

The question is loud in my thoughts lately, ""what if I'm fooling myself holding on so desperately to hope?"" The hope that one day I would have a full, healthy, connected life.  That I'd be free from my inherited class status, that all the people I've hurt intentionally and unintentionally, all the people who've hurt or left me... that'd I was smart enough and strong enough to outlast and dismantle all these things, and that there would be something worthwhile on the other side.  It was real hope that this could all be done.

I just can't stop hearing it now, ""what if hope is a lie?"""
1809,depression,(Seeking advice) Partner with depression unable to motivate or take care of themselves,"Throwaway account **

My partner who I live with and love dearly is struggling with depression and motivation (diagnosed ~10years ago). This has been a tough year made tougher by their shitty work situation. Between September and November things really became unbearable for them and they reached their mental breaking point. December on they have been unable to be self sufficient or find motivation for anything. They sleep 16 or more hours a day, spend most waking hours in bed or laying on couch, cannot make their own food, cannot clean up after themselves, cannot do laundry, need help with tasks like getting them things out of arms reach or going to the corner store for them or taking care of their pet etc. I do not have a problem with doing favors for the people you care about, but I mention this because its an excessive amount of requests, 20-30 tasks a day. And if I say no, it is met with anger that I am ‚Äúmaking‚Äù them do it themselves or they won‚Äôt do it at all.

Maybe most concerning is their coping with alcohol and marijuana. Drinking every day of the week and starting to drink around noon some days (work days). Smoking til they fall asleep mid work day as well, asking me to wake them if they receive a message from anyone on their work computer.

I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm helping by doing the things they can‚Äôt motivate themselves to do or ask of me while they heal, or if I‚Äôm making things much much worse by making them more codependent and comfortable in inactivity. Im finding it difficult to approach a conversation addressing the above as their natural defense mechanism to conflict (self described) is to become upset/ashamed to have this pointed or saying things like ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt be upset/mad/sad/annoyed with me‚Äù to end the conversation. I am human and sometimes my own emotions may taint the delivery of my concerns, but I honestly try very hard to check my emotions at the door when addressing a sensitive and personal conversation like that. 

 I‚Äôm coming here seeking advice and perspective. As time moves forward, the codependency and inactivity grows. They are aware of it too and speak about it by their own volition frequently. They have been trying virtual counseling/therapy but haven‚Äôt been able to really connect with anyone yet (and have rescheduled most of the sessions since signing up). They also take anti depressant medication, which they stopped taking for a few years but began again in January. They frequently say they do not feel any affect or that they are helping at all. They desperately want to break from their funk but cannot seem to do so.

Please help us with any strategies or advice you may have."
1810,depression,I‚Äôm Depressed,"And there‚Äôs no way around it. I‚Äôve felt this way for a long time. It‚Äôs destroyed my friendships by slowly wearing away at each one, and all I‚Äôve been capable of doing has been to emanate negativity and self hatred. My current friends seem to understand whenever I muster the courage to answer their ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up? Why are you so quiet now? Are you doin okay‚Äùs with simple explanations that I‚Äôm just depressed and get sad at random times. I want to be able to do better, and ‚Äúmatch their wavelength‚Äù or whatever, and be able to discuss things with them. The problem is, I don‚Äôt have anything to talk about. I haven‚Äôt dedicated myself to anything at all at this point in my life (22, turning 23 soon), with the exception of the Zelda series and to listening to and learning some songs by incredibly niche bands. Not discounting the credibility of those bands and their music, but none of that exactly gives me a leg up in society. Someone might think that dedicating yourself to getting good grades in school and earning an Eagle Scout would help with that immensely, but instead I chose to become an English major and get a stupid English degree with my parents‚Äô hard earned money. At the time I really thought I could find a pathway to a career that way, but as the time grows between the present and my graduation, the cold realization that I will never find anything that I can dedicate myself to (and be recognized by others as enough of authority on that subject to get a job) and the fact that I did not do enough sinks deep and seizes every muscle in my body. It‚Äôs hard for me to want to do anything at all, at this point, especially realizing how little I actually have to my name in terms of skills (or even money, for that matter). A good friend of mine introduced me to a whole bunch of music that I‚Äôd never listened to before and know I should be excited by, but it‚Äôs hard to find the time to listen to it. Plus a lot of it is oldish... but that‚Äôs usually not a problem for me, and I love 90s music, so it really shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. But everything is just so blah and whatever now. It‚Äôs all coated in a thick layer of SAD and the days blur together like a watercolor painting being rained on. Happy music doesn‚Äôt resonate with me and sad music just pulls me closer to my sadness. Angry music just deepens my resentment for the world and for my existence in general. It‚Äôs like everything that once gave me purpose is suddenly exacerbating everything bad about me and making me feel terrible. I‚Äôm inadequate. I have no self confidence and I never had it. Any confidence I ever had was given to me by friends and family, especially lovers though. I‚Äôm trying desperately to figure out how to get real confidence and how to discipline myself in a field like playing music to the point where I have the confidence to play in front of others again. Covid destroyed me and whatever semblance of self-love I had prior. Now I just smile like a dumbass whenever I‚Äôm around people and say nothing. I feel incredibly stupid constantly. Nothing connects for me. The world is a mess of chaos and disorder that I cannot keep up with. I‚Äôm trying to practice meditation as well, and have become intrigued by some Buddhist philosophies and meditative states to improve the well-being of mind, but I don‚Äôt know if this will help me be more social. I know I can say anything in front of my friends, but I don‚Äôt know what to say to them, if that makes sense. When people talk, a lot of their words go right over my head and keeping up with conversation is tragically difficult. So I can‚Äôt respond, and I‚Äôm left either nodding ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù or laughing or sighing at what they say. It feels moronic. They give me time to respond, and I‚Äôm always leaving that time an awkward silence. It‚Äôs been impossible for me to overcome. Nothing going through my brain is relevant enough to respond properly. It‚Äôs either too dark (in terms of me hating myself) or just too ‚Äúout there‚Äù. Am I not built for people? Even though I‚Äôve spent my whole life believing (and being told by my introverted family) that I am a people person and built my life so far around the social, like music, literature, and leadership? It just feels so stupid to me now. I feel incredibly discouraged. I‚Äôve had a nasty couple of years all through my entire college experience. I was dumped by my first (and only) long-term girlfriend, proceeded by my staying friends with her and her friends (which was ungodly bad for my mental health, but I just didn‚Äôt want to hurt anybody‚Äôs feelings), then the realization that engineering would kill me caused me to switch to English, proceeded further by the discovery that a ‚Äúgood‚Äù friend of mine and room mate was doing horrible shit to me behind my back, and finished off with a year of fruitless job searches in a covid wasteland. It hasn‚Äôt been all terrible as I also spent a good portion of 2020 in a casual relationship, which was fun but not at all a healthy relationship or a constructive one. I never got a real loose college party experience. I‚Äôve never been able to find a real and stable path to being a funny, or at least entertaining, person in social situations and all that stuff just made it infinitely worse. People still teach at me, saying I just need to do this or that or think some way in order to overcome this, but I just don‚Äôt see how I can do that. I tried meds for a while but they made me zombie-like. I would still get sad but be unable to cry, if that makes sense. I‚Äôm just the least fun person trying to make it in a world where fun dominates. It‚Äôs just fucking stupid and I belong in a basement, typing up reports and documents and boring ass sad shit because that‚Äôs what I am. People say they like me but I‚Äôve realized it‚Äôs just because I always agree with them, and since others notice this in me too, they exploit it (these are good friends I have now, they only choose to exploit it in minor ways to teach me not to do it), and I can‚Äôt help but realize what a human punching bag I am. I know I need more confidence and I need to know more about stuff in general, but honestly so little attracts my attention. I have to really dig to find anything that even remotely catches my eye. I‚Äôve held a resentment for being born since early childhood. A lot of it comes from the way my parents treated myself and my siblings when we were young, but as someone who‚Äôs made it this far, I really just want to find a job and create some stability for myself in making a home somewhere. Then I feel like I‚Äôll be a full human being. But I also realize that if I‚Äôm not happy now, then there‚Äôs a slim chance that I can ever be happy. More hardships are sure to come, and good times have felt so few and far between for such a long time now. So what is there to look forward to? How can I possibly escape this life of obscene mediocrity that I‚Äôve chosen for myself? Why have I been such a dumbass and never invested myself in anything beyond zelda and some specific genres of music and even more specific bands within those genres? I‚Äôve had such few passions and I‚Äôve seen each one of them burn before my eyes as I let the world rip them away from me. My scope of understanding is so small and irrelevant, I‚Äôm nothing but a bum waiting to be put out on the streets.. I‚Äôve experimented with drugs and honestly I just want as many opioids as I can get my hands on, I want to obliterate this pain and I‚Äôm starting to not care how I do it. If it‚Äôs not opioids then it‚Äôs gonna be alcohol. It‚Äôs been weed for a long while now, but weed‚Äôs shown me nothing and plagued me with more anxiety and harmfully invasive introspection. I‚Äôm just a sad empty-headed twat with nothing good to say. Look at all this worthless self-pity, all grammatically correct and everything. It‚Äôs atrocious and I‚Äôm an abomination. It would be wonderful if I could just blow my brains out, but I know how much pain it would cause those around me, so I guess that escape isn‚Äôt an option. But it SUCKS. Because suicide is my brain‚Äôs go-to. IT FUCKING SUCKS AND I HATE IT. I HATE THIS LIFE IT‚ÄôS BEYOND NOT WORTH LIVING IF I CAN‚ÄôT EVEN FUCKING SPEAK FOR MYSELF.  I don‚Äôt get pop culture references and I‚Äôve always found sports excruciatingly boring. I‚Äôm not into much of anything. My world is pretty damn empty, so most of what I say has no direction, like picking up sand only to scatter it on the wind of my breath. It‚Äôs such a mess it‚Äôs not even funny. Literally because nobody knows what I‚Äôm going for when I try to say anything. It‚Äôs just so hard to put my energy into positive things... it all seems so pointless to me... and that‚Äôs the extent of my personality... just sad..."
1811,depression,"have you found anything that helps, even just a little?",i dont know what to do anymore. i struggle to immerse myself in anything enjoyable when i have no interests or hobbies but im so bored and tired. nothing feels good. i have nothing to use as a distraction
1812,depression,why are the bad days just getting worse?,"i have no motivation to do shit, even answer the few friends i still have.

maybe thats for the best, couple weeks ago the person i considered my best friend basically told me to kill myself, maybe he just couldn't handle dealing with me anymore. id always apologize for making him deal with my negative bullshit and he used to send a smiley and say it was fine, he wanted to help...i guess i made him reach his breaking point with me then. who the fuck would be able to deal with a negative piece of shit like me for long?

logically i know im just making myself worse by isolating myself, but honestly i just feel so guilty whenever i do answer. its like im contaminating them with my negativity and depressing bullshit. i already ruined one person, id hate to do that to the rest.

every day just keeps getting grayer and grayer, tho...i find myself looking forward to nighttime so i can sleep and forget reality, and when im awake im consuming media so i can forget reality. a cycle of escapism no matter where i look, i can't enjoy reality at all. i wish i had something real to actually enjoy doing, something in this reality that i enjoy at all, but I don't have that.

in conclusion,
fuck."
1813,depression,Mother passed away today,"  

Today this morning my mother passed away and it's extremely painful. I can't stop crying and it's hard to keep myself together. She was diagnosed with colon cancer stage 4 January of 2020. On top of this she had diabetes and eye problems. I had known this was coming. I could see my mother gradually getting weaker. I'm very depressed and I just felt like I didn't get a chance to say I love her and wish I had been there more for her. I wanted to be able to talk with her one last time and say goodbye to her, but it just happened so suddenly. I can't stop thinking of the times I had with her and I just keep crying when I think of them. I feel like my brain and mind is shattered into pieces. I just wish thus was a dream and it feels like it, but it's not. I miss her so much.   


I feel like i'm starting to have depression symptoms. Ever since COVID started, thats when my mom had gotten sick. With both of those going on at the same time I just felt like the depression just seemed to be gradually progressing, at this moment I feel like its at its peak and I don't know what kind of help should I seek. I see my therapist regularly, I'm bumping it up to once a week now instead of every other week. I have a psychiatrist and I do have bipolar disorder, I don't have bipolar depression but its bipolar/manic disorder, but I know for people with bipolar situations like this are much harder to handle and deal with, I can't really handle it well and I legit can't stop crying. The medications i'm on are Seroquel and lithium, I know seroquel has antidepressant properties, but antidepressants are a last resort for now.   


Please, if anyone has been in the same shoes what kind of help and treatment should I get so that this depression that I have lingering doesn't get worse, i'm thinking of seeing a grieving counselor as well as seeing my therapist so maybe both on a weekly basis or something, unless my therapist offers that kind of services so I can go that route and see where that leads. I thank you all for your support, God bless all of you and I  hope whatever battles you are all facing you can overcome."

1815,depression,Feeling deja vu,"I haven‚Äôt cut myself in 4 years. However a year and a half ago I had a failed suicide attempt in my dorm room at college. The attempt came from 3 months of hard depressive thoughts and feelings. I just said fuck it and went for it. There was stuff going on in my life that triggered this response from me obviously, however I went through the same situation the other day and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about doing harming myself. I know I ultimately won‚Äôt at the end of the day but it sucks because I made so much progress and I feel so hurt right now."
1816,depression,I'm loosing my grip with reality,"First and foremost, I don't usually do any type of social media posts so if its a little off of what you are used to seing, I apologize. I don't wanna seem too much like a sob story either I just wanna get some stuff off my chest. Recently life has become hell for me, I live completely alone most of the time and have become really depressed. I've always had notions that life isn't real but I can't shake the idea as easily anymore. I am hallucinating more and more and constantly want to kill myself but I won't because I know it will hurt my friends and family. I keep cutting off connections with friends and acquaintances because I can't hide this stuff anymore. 

A year or two ago I started seeing and hearing things especially after I would do drugs. I've stopped the drugs and alcohol but I keep experiencing the hallucinations and focusing on them. Occasionally I feel really foggy  and it feels like the world isn't real. That's when I get really suicidal and it is a living hell. I had an encounter with a girl in my building who I thought was taking pictures of me and I started getting mad at her. When I realized it was a hallucination she looled completely terrified and wont look at me anymore. I feel unreal and this and COVID has really turned my life into a complete shitfest. 

I scheduled a consulting with one of the therapists at my college but my parents told me to work on it myself (as I use their insurance) which I know they are trying to help but they just don't get what its like. 

I don't wanna believe it's a mental illness because I know I can fix it, especially since covid is starting to go away. I'm just feeling really poopy right now and need some words of encouragement, thanks for coming to my ted-talk. (I tried to end it not so morbidly lol). If you read this, thanks. I love you.

1817,depression,I don't know why there are those people who hate me. What did I do to you? Why does my existence bother you? I'm doing my best to succeed and you hate it. You hate seeing me succeed. You want to bring me down. Why?,[removed]
1818,depression,I am so useless but I'm too much of a pussy to kill myself ccccc:,"Maybe this is one of my late night moods again but whatever I need to vent and Reddit is downloaded. But anyways, I feel so fucking useless. I'm talentless, I can't socialize properly, I have a horrible personality, I'm ugly, and I'm genuinely an asshole. I literally slapped my ballsack on the EVERY SINGLE BULLSHIT BRANCH of horribleness while swimming in my mother's vagina. Literally how the fuck was I the fastest sperm?????

My personality is most comparable to that one person in your friend group that no one likes but somehow, through the power of Jesus Christ himself, they always seem to hang around. Kinda like a cockroach infestation that even pest control can't get rid of. Das me, hello! I'm here and I come prepackaged with a gigaton of self loathing.

I would kill 110% kill myself, but apparently, I have been blessed by the power 10,000 little bitch boys and therefore, I am a coward. C:"
1819,depression,"I don‚Äôt have a lot of regrets, but this one haunts me.","I was 11 years old when my mom passed away. She was in and out of the hospital fighting lymphoma. She was never happy either and in constant pain for as far back as I can remember. Once she had her official diagnosis it was seldom that I ever saw her smile, and only cry. 

A few years later after being diagnosed, she was told that she has about a month to live, so my grandparents took me to visit her in the hospital. It was the first time I had seen her in 2 weeks, and we only stay for about an hour and the next thing I know I‚Äôm being taken home in the back of my grandpas car, clueless to what‚Äôs really happening to my mom. Skip ahead, and it‚Äôs the night of her passing. She only has a short time to live, and I‚Äôm told that I should come see her cause it will be my last time. I‚Äôm terrified and I refuse to go, and just the thought of seeing her made me extremely anxious. In that very moment, it was like reality struck me very hard and everything seemed clear, and despite my grandparents trying to protect me from the truth of what was happening to my mother, I knew exactly what was going on. And so, there I was at home alone by myself, and I remember wishing that I could reverse time. 

I am 24 now and the night my mom passed away haunts me. At the time, I was more scared of seeing her pass away in front of me, and I wish I had seen her or at least let her know I love her just by being there. I can‚Äôt help but feel terrible thinking how she must‚Äôve felt when her only son didn‚Äôt come to see her when she needed me the most. I‚Äôve been trying to overcome this for a while now, nothing works. I feel like I‚Äôll carry this weight on my shoulders for the rest of my life, and for a good reason too, I kind of fucked up bad."
1820,depression,When you are becoming depressed do you also get these kinds of memories?,"I have reoccurring depression. When I am entering depression, early phases, my brain finds these weird ass meaningless memories in which I was a failure, worthless, stupid, ect. I am bombarded by these different memories out of nowhere for about a week until the depression becomes worse. Then it becomes a blank nothingness.

Example, on a basic ass day, at work in the teacher lounge I said something kind of argumentative about someone's mlm. This made me feel stupid. This happened probably 4 years ago. I haven't thought about for 4 fucking years, at the night that it happened. It wasn't super argumentative, they said 'oh' and we went about our days.

Or memories of when I did something stupid in high-school, or failed at something. Sometimes even stupid things I did as a preteen.

These memories are always really old, something I never really thought about much. But I remeber them and feel awful about myself.

The thing that really gets me is I have a lot memory loss from ect and I have difficulty remebering what happened the previous day. But the stupid shit I did at 13 is there to haunt me."

1823,depression,I get jealous over friends receiving love and support,I dont receive any love and I dont have access to support or help. When I see friends with supportive and loving families and a healthy mental state for the most part getting counseling I get jealous and it puts me in a toxic mindset. I shut myself down to avoid being toxic but I cant stop the feelings of jealousy. I see others getting what I wish I could have and it messes me up and forces me to be selfish and focus on my own feelings the most.

1825,depression,When depression is making me want to kill myself I think of this stupid thing,"I've had depression since I was sixteen(28 now) and every now and then(literally every day) my depression tries to talk me into killing myself by any means possible. In the past it's almost won. Fuck that though, if this illness wants me dead so badly  it's gonna have to form a fucking tumor or something because I'm not doing its dirty work. I know living is hard lots of the time, but try to stay strong guys. 

Sorry if this post is a little lighthearted for this sub, I'm on a brief up at the moment."
1826,depression,I want to go home (vent),It feels like I‚Äôve been fighting for a life time. I always get anxiety when watching movies anime or playing games where you have to overcome something. I feel I‚Äôve spent my entire life overcoming and overcoming and overcoming. What‚Äôs the point? All I want to do is go home. I‚Äôm completely drained. I don‚Äôt want challenge. It especially drains me when looking at a anime where they have to overcome a big challenge and the path to that isn‚Äôt linear. If it‚Äôs linear like a dark souls game at the very least I have a route to take. But if there‚Äôs multiple paths filled with bumps and uncertainty I get annoyed. I‚Äôve been struggling for so long so fucking long... i don‚Äôt want to keep struggling I want to go home. You tease me make me feel you inside me and I feel the love the short moments of happiness. The journey fighting to go back has been so long and I‚Äôm tired now. But I can‚Äôt accept defeat because it would ruin me. I feel like I‚Äôm trying to change a crowd of peoples minds and they are so stubborn and even though I know for a fact I‚Äôm right the only thing to do is scream and shoot myself in the head to escape. But I can‚Äôt do that. So I‚Äôm just forced there to stare off into the void. Left to repeat over and over again... I want to go home I want to go home... I‚Äôm so confused.
1827,depression,mad scared right now,"just threw out all my weed and shit. made a promise to my self to be better and not such a lazy bum but honestly I just want to kill my self so badly right now. weed was the best form of escapism for me now I have nothing.

1828,depression,My life has been a failure,"I suck at my career which I've been doing for like a decade now and I've never accomplished anything meaningful with it. I've never been great, I'm always 3 steps behind everyone else and I don't know if I can hack it. I can't hack it at my current job and I'm gonna fail just like I always have. I have nothing to show for my work, because my peak is mediocrity veiled with a defensive coating of arrogance.

I can't relate to anyone or make meaningful relationships with people. I'm always fucking alone and I closet my emotions from everyone else by just saying ""I'm fine"" or shying the conversation away with some joke. I can't connect with anyone. I'm a recluse who won't ever be with anyone, even as a friend. 

I don't have any talents, I can't connect with people, I'm not productive, I can barely take care of myself, and I fuck up a lot. I've fucked up my life. I don't know how not to fuck up at this point."
1829,depression,Fuck it I‚Äôm getting hammered,"Long story short I told my best friend I love her. I‚Äôve been in love with her for four years and I‚Äôve told her before but she didn‚Äôt feel the same at that time. This time I still don‚Äôt know how she feels.

She also inadvertently made me feel bad for not making a move in four years but I feel like I‚Äôve tried so many times and nothing. 

I feel like we‚Äôre codependent with eachother and I lowkey hate it. I hate feeling absolutely awful and depressed whenever I tell her how I feel.

Like wtf do I even do at this point. If I cut her off I‚Äôll be way more depressed and drink wayy more like I used to. But if i stay her friend I‚Äôll still be depressed because I really do love her and it‚Äôs not reciprocated as far as I know.

Alright thanks for letting me rant reddit, I‚Äôm going to go drink a billion white claws now"

I have always struggled with depression but I just can't deal with it anymore. I'm mad all the time. Little things set me off an I feel like a ticking time bomb. I'm tired of the ER visits an medical debt because I am not taking care of myself. I'm tired of things never working out. I'm not happy and I'm miserable to be around. Debating leaving my husband so he can be happy. He doesn't deserve this an neither does my child. They both deserve a loving mother an wife but instead they are stuck with me. I yell an scream an I hate myself, I want to leave the hospital in a bag so they never have to deal with me again."

1840,depression,I can‚Äôt stand the thought of getting a career,"I don‚Äôt understand how people just accept their fates. I acknowledge that I am pretty lazy and I have a lot of things that I need to do, but I don‚Äôt understand how people can just go and have careers.

I don‚Äôt get how anyone can be ‚Äúcareer oriented‚Äù. It seems that at a certain point people just let their souls die. Once you finish college, or even highschool in some cases, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre signing the rest of your life away to be a wage-slave.

How can anyone say ‚Äújust do what you‚Äôre passionate about‚Äù. There‚Äôs nothing I am passionate enough to give away all of my free time to. I don‚Äôt know how I will wake up at 7 am every morning, get home at 5 with the whole day gone and then to bed at 10pm because I‚Äôll be old and tired. My whole life spent wasting away for a wage.

Am I missing something? I don‚Äôt see how people think it‚Äôs acceptable that this is the path humans take. You grow up and then slave away

Some people get lucky and are genetically blessed and can be actors or athletes while us peasants toil around.

I don‚Äôt see how you aren‚Äôt dead once your career starts.

My ideal career is something that is monotonous and at least doesn‚Äôt stress me out. It‚Äôs horrible enough that I will spend most of my life slaving away, at least don‚Äôt make it give me sleepless nights as well.

Then my life will just pass by thanks to my shitty career. What a great life. I don‚Äôt understand how or why people do it. I don‚Äôt see how I will do it. Life just seems like a complete slog. I just want to stay in and relax and do my own thing, but I‚Äôll instead have to submit to some boss, submit to an awful sleep schedule and have no hope of any work life balance. I don‚Äôt see how I will live many years of that."
1841,depression,Why am I even here? I should be dead already,"Why do I feel like I'm a complete failure? Probably because everytime I start something I never end up finishing it. Maybe it's because every social interaction makes me insecure. Or maybe it's because no one sees me as a normal person anymore. Maybe it's because of all of this. I just can't feel like myself anymore. I don't talk to anyone anymore, I don't eat, I don't sleep and I don't act like I used to. I can't even feel hapiness. I'm just so lost these past weeks, I can't find who I am. I wish things would get better. Isn't it what they all say? ""Things will get better"" How the fuck are you suppose to know if it will truly get better? From what I know it's only been going downhill for the past year. What‚Äôs the point in fighting for a happy ever after if the past keeps haunting the future? I tried everything, every single thing that people told me to do to feel better. I just can't get back to who I used to be, someone normal. I started to cut, drink and smoke. I don't even know why I do it, I guess it makes me feel better. I don't really know. I feel like everything I do is just a waste of time, I feel like even if I try to tell myself -Hey, you're fine. People care about you, people care about your feelings.- I just can't believe it. I can't believe what I'm telling myself. My life has been so weird lately. I just don't feel like I'm myself anymore. I want to end it, end it all. It doesn't mean to kill myself, it just means that I don't want to live like this anymore. Even if I wanted to kill myself I already failed it. I don't feel right, I seriously don't. I tried talking about it with people but I'm so insecure when it comes to talking with others that I never actually solved any of my problems. I wish someone could help me, truly help me."
1842,depression,I don't have a future...," 

I am a 15 year old, I cut myself with a sharpener blade. I have been doing this since March. I don't really do it for the pain, its just that seeing the beads of blood makes me feel calm whenever I'm angry or depressed. But I don't know how long this is going to go on. I'm worried. Also, I don't really have a passion. So I don't know what am I going to pursue in the future either. I just feel so done.

1843,depression,I‚Äôm ready to go,"When I kill myself tonight I‚Äôm going to think about everyone who tried to make me into a better guy. Anyone who tried to help me.

I‚Äôm helpless. I‚Äôm useless. And I‚Äôm scared. So I‚Äôm going to save everyone the trouble and kill myself. I feel bad abandoning them all but I can‚Äôt stand living anymore.

like I don‚Äôt belong in this category of depressed people because compared to others, I‚Äôve been blessed.

I know we shouldn‚Äôt compare whose had it worse, but I just don‚Äôt feel like I belong anywhere even when I‚Äôm with friends. I want to go home all the time. Even when I‚Äôm home, it feels like I‚Äôm not home. I‚Äôm tired of being high functioning and I just want to curl up into a ball until I know life has something for me.

1849,depression,[crowd-sourced] Remind yourself of what you've forgotten!,"After I struggled with depression for a bit, I noticed how some things that some thoughts are just harder to connect with than when you're not depressed. For example, ""it won't always feel like this"" is easier to agree with / believe when you're not so down.

To work around this issue, **I put a note on my phone that reminds me of some of those important thoughts that I tend to forget** when my mood goes sour. So far, I have:

* temporary mood: it won't always feel like this
* stop fortune-telling: you literally don't know the future, so you can't be afraid of / sad about it, just like bad things can surprise you, so can the unexpectedly good

**What other important ideas** / thoughts would you add to this, to short-circuit the vicious circle?"

1851,depression,worsening dysfunction,"just to preface, im 21 and ive been struggling with depression/other mood disorders for most of my life. this year started out horribly for me and i still have not moved past the emotional state i was in in january. it's may now and i've realized that every time i get in these frequent deep depressive moods i convince myself im going to end my life. doing this is the only thing that calms me down and makes me feel better about my life and situation. but because ive convinced myself im not gonna be alive soon, ive effectively gotten nothing done at all this year. i stopped participating in college classes, i put off everything, and i keep excessively spending money. 

ive gone through therapy before, multiple times. each time i just feel less and less like its working. at this point i've given up on myself and i cant find the will to keep trying to get better. i guess it would be nice if i knew other people can relate to dysfunction thing at least? planning to end my life on multiple occasions this year alone has seriously distorted pretty much everything"
1852,depression,Achieving your goals doesn't mean shit to depression,"I hated the way I looked and was fat for all of my adolescence so I lost weight, did ab workouts and got the body I wanted.   
    
I wanted to go to a good college so I studied hard and got a 1540 on the SAT.   
    
I felt like I was treating my mom poorly so I made an effort to spend more quality time with her and be nicer to her.   
   
But still, every fucking day I think about how much I hate life and how much I want it to end as soon as possible. Even though I've done things I thought would make me happy, I am still the same unmotivated, unconfident piece of shit I was 4 months ago. I don't know if anything will ever make me a functional, happy person. For the most part I have stopped giving a shit about school and sleep, I'm failing like 6 classes right now and I have a flat out 0 in 4 of those classes A WHOLE MONTH into the marking period. The stress and anxiety are killing me. The more my problems grow, the more the stress, anxiety, and vices grow. The more the stress, anxiety and vices grow, the more my problems go. It's like some fucked up mutualistic relationship. I'm only 16 and I still have so much to learn about life so I'll trudge through it for now but I still have a fucked up brain living in fucked up conditions and it's all my fault."
1853,depression,I can‚Äôt understand why,"Hi there, I‚Äôm 17F and I need some help. I don‚Äôt understand why I need the help because I have the perfect relationship, perfect job and o don‚Äôt really have any issues with my life but I constantly feel down and at loss of motivation. The thought of scuicide passes through my mind almost daily... I‚Äôm at a loss of what‚Äôs wrong with me or what could make me feel this way..."
1854,depression,These past five months I've been basically building up the courage to kill myself...,"I was suicidal in December now its may and a lot of shits happend in April. Everyday has been fucking terrible since the 6th. If it wasn't for the stuff on valentine's day we'd still be fine maybe. All I have to blame is myself, I tried blaming it on ""higher forces"" like demons n stuff but eventually turned to alcohol and pot to suppress how I've felt. It's only gotten worse and I'm afraid one day I'll be fed up and be done. I've been suicidal before all this but fuel has been added that makes me feel it even more. I'm scared, alone, confused, and tired. I wish I could have the one friend back who actually made me happy but now he wants nothing to do with me but I dont blame him. This is karma for shit I've done in my past life. I was feeling pretty good last week but I felt I didn't even deserve to feel that way. Idk its 4 am I need to sleep and not obsesse over dumb shit so goodnight."
1855,depression,I feel like I can't do anything beyond the bare minimum of getting through each day,[removed]
1856,depression,Feeling," **CW???? Mentions of Offing themselves and Self hatred**

Everyday is the same wake up, get ready for online school, sit in a class I don't even listen to, after class go back to bed for a couple hours then stay up half the night. Again. And again over and over and over until someday maybe I'll realize its not worth it. It's not worth living another day. Breathing the same air as the ones above me, better than me. Lives worth more than mine . I'm just a mistake its my fault for being a burden for not having the motivation to clean my room, for not being happy all the time, for making my family worry about me not being ""the same happy little **GIRL** you used to be"". Maybe one day I'll act on those feelings, get tired of the voices in my head telling me to just end it all, get tired of feeling like everyone is laughing at me, making fun of me, get tired of not being a **NORMAL** happy **GIRL**....

Yeah but not today... Maybe tomorrow

1858,depression,My life is definitely gonna end in suicide,I know it for a fact. I‚Äôve been trying to build up to it but it‚Äôs not that easy. Life really just isn‚Äôt worth living.
1859,depression,"quick vent. tired of hearing i'm ""high functioning""","i'm sick of it. my mother's the only person i know who openly talks about my mental illnesses and she says i'm ""fine"" because i'm ""high functioning"", as if that means i don't feel like shit about myself every day. makes me feel more guilty to be honest. feels like people don't care about me because it seems like i'm getting by, like i don't have depression to them because they can't see it themselves, if that makes sense. i don't even know what's going on in my life anymore, i've been so out of it for so long. not on meds anymore because they haven't been helping, plus every psychiatrist and therapist i've been with so far don't quite get me. i don't think there's any hope left. i just wish i could die"
1860,depression,I'm not sure what's going on,"I never had any mental health issues before. I suddenly felt stressed and exhausted. I went for a medical checkup and everything was fine. I was still struggling with anxiety that took months to ease up. I still get that occasionally though. I decided to get a mental health checkup. I went to a couple different places over a period of several months. I explained everything and that said it could be stress. 

Currently I'm working and staying active. My appetite is fine, sleep is tough at times, I get vivid dreams more often now, and I find I'm less interested in being social than I used to be. I tried some online depression tests and the results vary quite. I'm not asking for a diagnosis. I'm just sharing my experiences and having a hard time figuring this out."

I know I'm going to fail my math courses. I have no idea what the fuck I want to do. I'm absolute shit at studying and time management, so that's going to give me even more stress. I'm going to have a really hard time socializing with roommates (I'm an extremely private person that absolutely needs alone time to survive). I'm going to have mental breakdowns and cry and it's going to be humiliating doing it in front of roommates. It's going to be harder to talk to my LDR partner over the phone BECAUSE of roommates (did I mention I'm a really private person?). 

I'm 100% sure I have severe depression and it makes surviving every day a living hell. I cry every day, go into deep depressive episodes regularly, have suicidal thoughts almost every day, and get overwhelmed very easily by the simplest shit.  I can't be around people for more than a few hours because my social battery drains really quickly. 

I'm going to college not because I necessarily want to, but because my parents are forcing me to. The only reason I'm ""excited"" to go is to get away from this toxic household and try and finally get the help I need. 

Thinking about all this right now makes me so anxious and depressed and scared because I know It's going to be a living hell and I barely am able to take care of myself. I don't know what to do. I'm really scared..."

Then this girls abusive exboyfriend starts bothering. He went to her job and made a scene just because he found out she was dating someone. I let it go and thought it was just a one time thing jealousy act. About a week ago he starts texting her insulting her and insulting me. After years of loneliness, depression, and just pure darkness, I finally have someone who I enjoy being with and who cares about me as much as I care about her, and this motherfucker who used to abuse her thinks he's gonna get away with doing the same shit. So I called the guy and asked him where he was and see what happens to all his macho attitude. He didn't wanna tell me. I stalked him on social media a bit and found out where he works. Went to his job so that he could see I was being serious, but I lost it and beat him up bad. I got arrested. I'm currently out on bond and eating for a court date. I'm the dumbest person alive.

I now realize the cops should have handle it and not me. I feel like I threw my whole life away, now that I will have a criminal record. I so fucking self destructive. I hate myself. I've never even been violent. I got bullied from middle school through high school and never did anything. I don't know what got into me. I'm so fucking depressed again.

When he passed away I couldn't hand the pain and the drawl so I stopped eating, I didn't want to live anymore, that simply 
It was. In a few months I lost near a 40 libs. I looked like a junkie, the kind of people you find sleeping in the subway. I couldn't recognize my face in the mirror, and I didn't care anyway, I was just waiting the time to pass and finally die, nothing else. Even I didn't dream anymore, I just couldn't have dreams while being asleep like the rest of the world, my soul was totally broken. Regarding my desires of death, deep in my mind I knew I was wrong, and one day I just snapped, my brain made the ""CLICK"". I started to eating and sleeping like before the tragedy, I started to believe that like was worth the effort. I dreamed with my dad once, and we say good bye to each other. For make it clear, I was 19 and this happened in 2016. I finished school and I find a job. This wasn't easy but I did it, I made it real.

1871,depression,Fake it 'til you make it? Chronic depression and sex drive,"Hi everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

It's my first post, so go easy on me!

I have chronic depression and anxiety. I was first diagnosed at age 12 and I am almost 34 now. I have been on and off meds since then, but have been very much on them for the last decade. In my case, it is both chemical imbalance (runs very deep in my family!)  and situational (bullied daily at school from about age 9 through to graduating + toxic relationship with my single mother). 

 I have been on tons of different meds and have been to countless therapists, but therapy and CBT have never really worked for me despite being a completely open book and willing guinea pig! I have also received in-patient treatment without any long-term success. 

At the moment, I am on Effexor 225mg and I have Pax to take when needed. I tried to come off my medication a couple of years ago but I couldn't even talk without breaking down in tears. I was disappointed because I had never thought I would have to be on medication probably forever. But I have more-or-less come to accept that this might just be what's necessary to keep me stable. It sucks, it's expensive....and it's KILLED my libido. 

I have never really been a super sexual person in the first place (my love language is cuddling and watching series) but it is now completely gone. This could be the depression, but I suspect the meds are playing a huge role. But I also can't come off them because I have exhausted my options (I live in South Africa and we don't have all the same treatment options available). I am also engaged to the most amazing person in the world and I am terrified because I know that a healthy sex life is crucial in a healthy relationship. But I am never horny. And while I do have sex with him maybe once a week, I know that, while he is being incredibly supportive, that his needs aren't being met. 

What can I do in this situation? Any hacks for faking yourself into a state of arousal?"
1872,depression,Idk what I‚Äôm doin here,"You ever just take a step back and look at yourself and think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm such a piece of shit‚Äù... idk why I‚Äôm writing here I can‚Äôt think straight, I just need a sharper knife, idk I just feel like no matter what I do I‚Äôm gonna lose everything and I feel like I bring no value to anyone, like I‚Äôm just a walking corpse I can‚Äôt even hold a fucking conversation anymore"
1873,depression,hopeless,[removed]
1874,depression,Is it normal to feel nauseous when you‚Äôre sad?,"I get really bad waves of sadness throughout the day, especially at nighttime, and I get extremely nauseous and physically ill. Sometimes I throw up and just end up staying awake because of how sad and anxious I am. Is that normal? Or should I tell my doctor in my next appointment?"
1875,depression,"It‚Äôs like people can‚Äôt even look at me, and are avoiding talking to me.","I‚Äôm deeply depressed. I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm crying all the time and can‚Äôt sleep ever. I have had some suppressed trauma memories come up and I can‚Äôt live with them. I feel so numb most the time I don‚Äôt feel like eating, and normally I‚Äôm the kind of person that eats when I‚Äôm upset. I‚Äôm numb. Suicidal. I keep trying to talk to people about how much I hate being in my own skin and that I want to die so these thoughts aren‚Äôt trapped in my head. I need to say them, I don‚Äôt want them to take over and be true. Yet when I say them every one of my close friends get this gross look on their face and they try to change the subject. I can tell they can‚Äôt handle what I am going through. They don‚Äôt know what to say. I have a therapist, she‚Äôs okay. I feel like no one believes me and like I‚Äôm faking how much I wish I could just end it without hurting anyone right now. I just know if I ended it people would have to live with guilt thinking they caused it by not saying ‚Äúthe right things‚Äù and I don‚Äôt want to give people that feeling."
1876,depression,Why shouldn't I give in?,"If everything is hopeless, why should I try to do anything better? ""Because it's not hopeless"" yeah, it's really hard to make anyone understand this but, I tried to change, I wanted to change for years but nothing happened because I fail everything. Just, think for a second, if for my whole life, for 23 years, I didn't succeed ≈ün a single simplest thing, why would it suddenly change? Wouldn't it be magical?

And then there's me, I am being lazy all day, every day. People say that it's because of depression, but this depression isn't going away. I just don't want to do something that will be hard for me. Like, idk working out, cleaning my room, helping with anything... Nobody really wants to do that but people does that, I don't, generally. So, again, it's expected from me to not to achieve anything.

And I know that everything is hopeless, you might say that it's feeding this situation but I see this as another reason why everything is hopeless, because my thoughts are feeding it.

I am thinking of, giving up on therapy. Because my problems are real, not in my head. I mean for example, I don't know anything and I don't have any skills and I am broke, and I can't live with my parents anymore. Think for a second, what can they do? They could encourage me to finish school but it will take me 4 years, yeah it's too late. They could encourage me to work in a minimum wage job (which, I can not because of a lot of reasons, I ruin everything, I can't literally talk to anybody), minimum wage will not cover my therapy, a healthy diet and lessons to improve myself. So here, I am having a real problem and it's making me depressed. I might talk about my feelings, I might use medicine but, I will still be broke. So this real problem persists, so, I don't know maybe I will magically be happy but... You see it right. This is just an example ny the way there are a lot of real problems I have which can not be solved with therapy.

I was trying to lose weight and work on my junk food addiction. I am thinking of you giving up now. I wasn't eating junk food but I guess I will just go and eat what I want to eat today. Because FUCK EVERYTHING!

Why am I working at all? Therapy, diet fuck them all I am hopeless and I am giving up!"
1877,depression,Just relapsed on self harm for the first time in years,"Amazing how just a little house key can rip off a decent amount of skin, although to be fair I haven't really been eating much and I've lost so much weight following a breakup in December. This ugly, pasty white skin is much easier to break because of that I would imagine.

Good thing my job site has a first aid kit so I can just lie and say I fell/scraped myself on something."
1878,depression,Am i depressed?,"im 15 and i ask myself am i even actually depressed? i cant afford therapy and my family does not believe in mental health. When i search up online i can mostly relate to almost all of the symptoms. When i tried to talk to someone its people just saying i am being dramatic. I am miserable all the time, i feel worthless and constantly consider the possibility like ""how happy would everybody be if i was just dead"". I have become so lazy over time and have no interest in anything. I am always told by pretty much everyone around me especially my parent like ""you are a curse and we wish you would just kill yourself or just die"" and honestly i too wish that i too wish i was dead because i know that i am too much of a coward to actually do it but i know that i just would be better of dead."
1879,depression,Guilt from taking time off work,Had an especially rough night and now I have to be up for work in 3 hours. I'm lucky enough that I get a couple paid leave days but I feel guilty about using them. I've only ever used it once for a family issue which helped me validate it but now I'm dreading writing the email to my supervisor and contemplating going to work mentally exhausted. I feel like there could be stigma around mental health especially since I work with a lot of older people who I feel will judge me as a young professional. I hate the idea of being seen as making excuses or my depression not being a valid reason for calling out of work.
1880,depression,"I feel guilty:,)",I hate how my parents won't accept me for what i do but it makes me happy like idk what to care for bc i end up putting them first
1881,depression,Made the mistake of looking through my past IG posts and it just reminded me of all the friends I‚Äôve pushed away,"I used to have SUCH an amazing friend circle. We did so many fun things. I looked back through my feed and was reminded of themed parties, silly drunken nights, soooo many evenings spent laughing. 

Thennn depression hit. I didn‚Äôt recognize it for what it was so I didn‚Äôt seek help. It turned me into such a grouchy, irritable mess. I never wanted to hang out with anyone. I would sometimes try just so I didn‚Äôt lose my friends but they could sense I didn‚Äôt want to be there. 

I moved away to a different state. Haven‚Äôt spoken to any of them in two years. Finally got myself the help I needed all along and am out of the fog enough to realize how fucking lonely I am and just what I gave up. 

There is no chance of reconciliation. Zero. Even if there was, I live eight hours away now. 

I have no friends here. I know I need to rebuild a friend group but at this point in a different state in a different city starting completely from scratch, I‚Äôm lost. I don‚Äôt know how. I‚Äôm not a very social person. 

What a mess I‚Äôve made."
1882,depression,Feeling exhausted and stressed,"Over the past few years, I‚Äôve gotten a lot better handle on my negative emotions and don‚Äôt let it affect my actions towards other people. But today, I lost control of my temper and was being kind of abrasive towards my online friends, and now I feel like crap. 

I guess it doesn‚Äôt help that my life has been so stressful lately. I have been having terrible thoughts again about wishing my existence ceased to exist. It‚Äôs not that I actively wish to harm myself. I just want a break from life for just one second."
1883,depression,I wanna kill myself for being transgender (suicidal rant internalized transphobia),"I am out to a few people in my life and they are very supportive yet from a very young age my father would call me a dyke and faggot even when I was just playing with my cats at 13 he would say ""of course you play with pussy you dyke"" or ""no man will ever love you you're to much of a dyke this is why you're a faggot"" (I was gay before transgender) even if he was joking it feels like I don't deserve life  after he almost shot me after coming out realizing I was an adult and he could do nothing about it but kill me I lived but no matter how much support everyone else gives me I am ashamed to be this way honestly I used the men's rest room today which no one question I pass well yet when I came out I hoped someone would beat me and kill me I just want this suffering to end I am happy with my body  yet the fact I am happy makes me feel less deserving of life I was a repressor unitll 18 after a suicide attempt realize I can't repress anymore I feel like a freak of nature no one will love I'm so close to caving in why would I exist just to be bullied transphobia is worse then ever before in the world even if other transgender people help me it feels like they are all just freaks like me trying to make themselves feel better why can't I feel deserving of life I don't think i can cope anymore"
1884,depression,Nothing to look forward to,"There's no enjoyment in my life. I don't really know what to do. I have nothing going on. Every day is the same. Wake up, work, eat, sleep. I look forward to getting home from work every day just to realize there's nothing for me to do. My hobbies have all but lost their fun. Haven't enjoyed a game since last september. Have barely touched my guitar. Can't concentrate on anything. I'm unbearably lonely which is a feat because I do quite like being by myself but it's really gotten to the point where it's making me even more miserable. I've never had a strong friend group despite trying. I would love nothing more than to make music with people but in my multiple efforts of trying it has always failed. I'm 20 and have never had a girlfriend or sex. I'm not an incel loser and don't hate women, it's obviously my fault. I'm completely undesirable. I tried tinder. Had one date that went well then ghosted. Had a date with a different girl and while we're still talking I don't think she's into me as much as I am her. This all feels so worthless. I don't have fun I don't enjoy things. I'd love to just hang out at a friend's house and watch a movie but I'll probably just drink myself to sleep again. This has been rambling and all over the place I'm just so completely unsatisfied with every facet of my life. This isn't worth it."
1885,depression,I messed up the most crucial years and my life will never get better.,"I used to be someone with such a bright future ahead. Or at least it seemed so. I graduated top of my class and went to med school, but I dropped out only after the first year. Thing is, I do enjoy studying, and it's probably the only thing I'm good at. However, I'm terrible at managing stress. The long study hours, waking up extremely early to commute, having no friends, and a general sense of not really having passion for Medicine ended up taking a mental toll on me and I dropped out. I realized that there's really nothing I'm passionate or genuinely love, I just want a stable job with a stable income to support myself and my unproductive hobbies. This exact lack of ambition is what ultimately caused my downfall. I chose Medicine because I was told the entire time of doctor's secure employment, being highly esteemed, etc. etc. and I went with it thinking it was the safe path, never considering that I lacked the intelligence and ambition to make it.

My Asian family is very conservative, and they took horribly my news of dropping out. They told me I quit because I was lazy, because I didn't try hard enough, that I never finish anything, etc. etc. And their reaction made me fall into a deeper depression. I was already having a hard time in school, so hearing my parents berate me instead of comfort me through a difficult moment was so hard to process. I've realized that I'm nothing more than a trophy for them to brag to their friends and family and I failed to do my job, and now I'm worth less that dirt to them.

After that I started working odd jobs and helping them out, all while holding the faith I'd one day go back to college. One day I find what is it I like and want to do for the rest of my life. It has taken me very long I admit, but it's hard for me as I spent my entire youth studying just for the sake of good grades and never developed interest for any particular subject.

And then I became 23, and my parents started pushing me to go to blind dates, to chat with their friends' sons in hopes that a relationship can start from there. They told me I was at the age of getting married and having children. And when I told them I actually wanted to go back to college and make something out of myself before even thinking of marriage, they immediately rejected the idea. They told me I wasn't capable nor smart enough for that, and that marrying someone with a stable job or business was the absolute best way to find money. I honestly don't want to be married nor have children anytime soon. Maybe never. I've even considered being aromantic or maybe I'm just not ready. I don't think I'll ever be as long as I feel this unstability in my head.

We had a huge discussion, and now I'm goong through a panic attack. Because I've realized that my life won't ever get better from here. I've got no university diploma, no real job experience, and I'm financially dependent of my parents so going against them would guarantee getting kicked out of my home. I've been frantically searching for jobs online that require no experience, cheap apartments, and what careers I could complete and find a decent job with despite being stupid.

My parents haven't seriously said they'll kick me out, but just the fact that I could lose their financial support one day and probably die on the streets, the fact that I'll always have to depend of someone, my parents, a husband, etc. to get by in life. It's fucking making me insane but at the same time I feel like I'm too stupid and useless to even attempt to survive on my own if I try to live by myself. Why couldn't have taken a different path after high school, not overestimate myself and study something less hard.

I'm scared, I feel like my life will never get better, I hate myself for making such terrible decisions, I hate that money exists, I hate that I'm not smart nor passionate enough, my self-esteem is on the floor and my anxiety on the roof.

It's a fear that has been gnawing at me ever since I was young, the possibility of not being a competent person that can support herself. I made all my life choices based on that goal alone but I completely failed because I'm stupid. And now I'm an adult and my fear has come true and I don't know what to do."
1886,depression,Why is everyone ditching me ?,"I never had a real friend and whenever I become a bit closer with somebody they ditch me few days later. I feel like I'm cursed or something. I do not change my behaviour or anything and really have no clue why is that happening. Like at first they tell me how awesome I am only to become so distant few days later. 
I'm becoming more and more scared of getting into some closer relationships with anyone, and I'm talking only about becoming friends, nothing more. I feel like I'm just a complete misfit that will never be dear to anyone"
1887,depression,I feel like I‚Äôve been dead ever since the first time I wanted to kms but didn‚Äôt.,"The first time I was ever severely suicidal was about a decade ago, I didn‚Äôt not do it because I decided I wanted to live, I didn‚Äôt do it because my parents. Maybe that reason to live is enough for a bit, but for how long? Am I really living if I‚Äôm only living for other people? Will I ever want to be alive again? 

I‚Äôve done everything I‚Äôm supposed to do to try to treat my depression and other mental health issues, but nothings ever helped besides relationships that inevitably end and leave me worse than before. 

Despite all this, I‚Äôm still moving forward on paper. I moved out of my home state, I‚Äôm in grad school, I‚Äôm trying. But I‚Äôm still the same. I still don‚Äôt want any of this. I‚Äôm tired of going out in the day and trying to function and then coming home and collapsing and crying and staring at walls and having my parents tell me I‚Äôm handing it all so well."
1888,depression,invisible,"i don‚Äôt know if this is directly related to my depression or something else.... but does anyone else feel like they don‚Äôt make a mark on anyone‚Äôs life? like, i have a couple friends but if i wasn‚Äôt here they would be completely fine. like i‚Äôm nothing special. i don‚Äôt add or take away from anyone‚Äôs experience. i don‚Äôt do anything exciting or creative. i‚Äôm just here floating it seems like. nobody thinks of me first or needs me anywhere. it‚Äôs sad but i hate to pity myself for something that feels like my fault"
1889,depression,I‚Äôm just so f*cking tired of this,"I wake up every day majorly depressed. It‚Äôs like a giant cloud that never goes away. I fake that I‚Äôm fine and I force myself to go about my day. I‚Äôm a full time college student double majoring in genetics and microbiology and I work in a research lab, and I can‚Äôt afford to let myself fail. Even when I just want to curl into a ball and cry myself to sleep and give in to self harm urges, I force myself to do what I need to do that day. But I‚Äôm so tired of living like this and I just want to be happy again. I‚Äôve gotten so good at hiding my depression that not a single person knows when it‚Äôs bad, even my own parents could tell my psychiatrist if my meds were helping or not. I‚Äôm tired of ‚Äúalways being so happy and energetic‚Äù and ‚Äúalways willing to give‚Äù without receiving nothing in return. I know I shouldn‚Äôt think that way, but I feel forgotten and alone and like no one cares. I‚Äôm technically diagnosed bipolar 2, but sometimes I doubt it because my meds don‚Äôt help anymore and I‚Äôm mostly just depressed. It takes everything in my to keep going every day and it‚Äôs exhausting. I was diagnosed with depression at age 7 and I‚Äôve been living like this for almost 11 years, and I‚Äôm just so done with all of it. I want so desperately to be happy and for this cloud to go away, but I‚Äôve kind of lost hope. I‚Äôve tried so many things and I feel like the only way out is killing myself, but I could never do that to my family and friends. I exercise daily, eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep, take my vitamins, etc. All the things people say because ‚Äúit‚Äôs just situational.‚Äù Maybe, but it‚Äôs been 10 fucking years and it‚Äôs never gotten better. The worst part is that depression is so glamorized today that I feel like some overdramatic teenager when I tell someone I‚Äôm struggling. But even when I tell people that I need help, they don‚Äôt seem to care and they do the basic minimum. Like, ‚Äúoh, I‚Äôm sorry. I hope it gets better soon.‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry for this long post because I‚Äôm ranting now, but I‚Äôm so alone and this is really my only outlet. Thank you for reading."
1890,depression,Im honestly really scared,"I've been drunk every day for the last two weeks. I'm scared i'm going to start doing drugs again. I used to be pretty hard on pills until i ended up in the hospital. Then after a two years of staying clean i moved onto stims pretty hard for about a year. These last few years i've replaced drugs with alcohol because of my job. This last year has been absolute hell for me. I've tried to do the deed, i've been SH. I've been drinking so much more. I've been drunk every day for the last two weeks. 

For the last few months before that i was drunk at least every other day. In less than two months i'm finally going to be done with my job and go to college. I'm excited, but i'll finally have the freedoms i had a few years back when i was abusing drugs. I'm especially scared about taking pills again. After my hospital thing, I wanted nothing to with pills. But my depression and anxiety has been so bad lately, all i can think about is taking pills again.

1895,depression,My work held a small get together/party for everyone tonight. I stood outside too afraid to go in and talk to anyone and just went home,"So it was a small office mixer in celebration of Easter and the long weekend we all have coming up. And it was held at some upscale little club that also had a second level to it so you could look out over a balcony to the street. Some part of me said I should go, mainly because I've worked at this company for two years now and single digit amount of people know who I am, and we're not that big of a company. ""You have to leave your comfort zone"" they said. There was even one girl I knew that had gotten out of a relationship recently I was hoping to chat with and get to know better. Maybe it would go somewhere.

I took a Lyft there and came around the street corner and immediately as soon as I saw people walking in and how busy it was, I shut down and nearly threw up from nervousness. But I had a jacket with a hood on it and threw my head on and I walked down the street a bit to get a better look inside since it just had big open windows you could see all the way in. It just looked...fun. Everyone just looked like they were having a great time. And the music playing was actually good and stuff I like to listen to. Everyone in there looked happy and glad to be there, even the people who came by themselves. Meanwhile, I'm stood on the other side of the street in an alleyway watching the whole thing hoping not to get noticed.

I also did notice the girl I liked walk in with a few co-workers and that was when my urge to actually go over and head in was at its strongest, but my feet still felt like they were in cement shoes and I didn't move, continuing to stand there like some creeper and outcast. I even saw her sitting at the bar by herself, bored out of her mind it seemed, but pretty as she always is.

Eventually I just gave up and walked back around the corner and called for another Lyft to get me and I went home. I threw and broke something off my coffee table out of anger and kicked one of my kitchen cabinets as well. Then I went and sat in my room in complete darkness and silence, thinking about how much I failed.

I just wanted to tell someone about this. Call me whatever you want, I don't really care at this point. Don't really care about a lot of things anymore."
1896,depression,Ever been in the middle of the club and still depressed? Right now? oh okay me too,I didn‚Äôt come dressed and I don‚Äôt feel pretty. It was good at first.

1897,depression,Life is so easy.,"Just imagine how easy it would be to just get up in the morning and go to work. Think about how even though some ‚Äònormal‚Äô (mentally stable) people might not want to go, they do anyways. Imagine how easy it would be to get up and simply be able to do things. Productive things. Hobbies. Jobs or Job interviews. School. Socializing. Consistent routines. Relationships.

1900,depression,"I can't convince myself to act, even if I'm aware I should. I don't know why I decided to write this,but any thoughts?","M29, I've been depressed for a long time, years in fact. A lot have happened in my life, and it took me a lot of time to put a word on some of these events, and even acknowledge what repercussions they had on me.


Recently, I had a session with a therapist who wanted to see if I was mentally able to work. It was a mandatory interview within a project to help me find a job. After the session, she told me to seek for therapy, indicated where I could find options within my very limited budget. She also asked me to keep her informed about what I decide.


But here's the thing. I know I have issues. Self-esteem, trust,etc... But I can't bring myself to try this. I can't help but think I'm overreacting, I'm being a drama queen, other people has had a lot worse than me... I think of this because I specified my age at the beginning, but I also find myself thinking I'm... Too old to have these issues? When I talk to my friend about my past, I totally ""accept"" this part of my personality, but when it comes to my (I don't know the word in english, unability to make anything? ) , I can't help but think I use it as an excuse to be lazy. 


Even writing this, I think how I'm saying some rather commonplaces, and someone will just call me out for faking or being over dramatic.


Does someone could explain to me why I call myself depressed while refusing to seek professional help?

1901,depression,Middle School Teacher Ruined My Life,"Below is a poem I wrote 10 minutes ago, laying on my couch as my wife sleeps in the room one over. When I was 12 I was dumb, I came out as transgender. My guidance counselor made me regret this decision every single day, I was told I had a disease that could harm others and I need to be contained till I did not have this disease any longer. Every day in 7th grade for 3 months I would see my counselor and he would lock me in a closet after yelling at me for an hour if I still said I was transgender. After three months I went back in the closet. I stayed their for 11 years, I missed important lessons, my grades plummeted, I always wanted to be a lawyer when I was little. I graduated high school with a 1.9 GPA. 

&amp;#x200B;

He ruined my life, I have tried to end my life twice, nothing recent though. But I am still horribly depressed and full of anxiety. I am looking for a job now but my grammar sucks I am stuck. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The darkness is not scary, but not being able to leave is where the fear lies.

Dark circles, Dark rims, Dark hair. Locking the ones full of light in the darkness.

No life, No air, the flicker quickly vanishing in the dark.

Eyes shut to escape their dark to be in your dark. Your dark is controllable.

Your dark is still full of light.

Your dark is the crisp morning air with the stars above and birds waking up bringing light to you.

Your light is the birds chirping and the asphalt below your tires, the wind in your hair. The flash of a car and the darkness stealing time away from your light. The birds chirping and the darkness telling you to keep your eyes closed. The darkness will be done with you soon.. then you can pretend it never happened and you can enjoy the light again. Enjoy the light, lay in the sun, enjoy the warmth. 

Eyes open, it's dark but it's your darkness, your darkness is safe, till you fall into his darkness. His darkness is not supposed to be dark. Dark Rims, Dark Circles  are not supposed to be dark they should be full of light, full of guidance, counsel you into the light. Lifting you up, but in the end pushing you deeper into their darkness. You go into your darkness, the darkness you once controlled. The darkness full of birds chirping, stars lighting your way, the dark asphalt, the darkness experienced in the day. The darkness. The dark that blends into the rest of the room. Not being able to leave the darkness. Lying trapped in the darkness."

1903,depression,What even makes people happy ?,"I can't identify any emotion within me apart from pure negativity and anxiety.
I'm currently an undergrad and live alone. I'm working as an intern.
The days are just painful. I don't know why I get out of bed apart from having to check up on work. I have a mild headache throughout the day, am always on the verge of crying (but never can) and just feel empty.
On the surface I'm doing very well. I have a very decent intern, I'm in a very well known college, have good job offers and appear to have goals. But what people don't realise is that all this crap is made up. I only work like a maniac because it stops reminding me of my sorry life and I stop feeling miserable. All my goals are just made up in my mind to keep me going somewhere (I have no idea what I actually want to do). 
People tell me to do some hobby or do something which makes you happy. I have no hobbies and don't even know what makes me happy. The sheer level of my anxiety also prevents me from actually doing anything that isn't work or study related. Now even my friends avoid talking to me because all I can talk about is work or go on rants.

It's not as if I haven't tried going for professional help. I'm on medication and take a ton of pills everyday but there have been occassions where I've just wanted to end it all.

It all looks like a rant again but all I'm asking is a simple question. How do people get hobbies and what even makes them happy ?"
1904,depression,About to graduate from nursing school and not sure if I want to be a nurse...feeling like I wasted 4 years of my life,"I was always excited to be a nurse but I think seeing the pandemic's effect on healthcare workers really just makes me not want to be a nurse anymore. Seeing my roommates and friends during college not having to worry about it, having high-paying jobs, etc makes me depressed when nurses are expected to do so much and get so little out of it. I don't know how I can switch careers or go back to school without having to spend so much money. I'm feeling so empty and depressed now, I feel like I majorly fucked up. I want to kill myself idk it just seems so much easier than living a life that I don't want to live"

Mentions of Depression, Self-Harm, Depressing Thoughts

‚Äã

So yeah I wanted to vent about this, I will clarify first I love my sister and so does she, she just can be kina insensitive and it can hurt a lot.

My sister (16 F) isn't exactly the best with emotions, I am a 13 F and have had depression for about 5+ years.

She found out about my self-harm along with my family, and the first thing she says to me is: 

""People who do self-harm is stupid, self-harm is stupid""

It hurts, and I don't really know what to think of it, I don't even know if I'm right in saying she's wrong.

1906,depression,Unmotivated between jobs (schools),"Hey guys, I found that I am unable to enjoy my alone time for quite a long time. As the covid lockdown happened and me graduating from school. The gigantic amount of time really makes me depressed. I was always focused on my career, studies, or building romantic relationships. Now, I have nothing to do and I don't feel motivated to keep myself busy with studies when I don't have to. 

Although I used to be very motivated on working out, reading, music etc. I don't feel the enjoyment of doing anything for a few months.

My only hope is that everything returns to normal when my school starts in Aug. Still, it feels like a very long time for me to kill. Please comment your advice on this situation."
1907,depression,Fuck depression,"Didn't workout for weeks. Earlier I worked out. Wasn't my longest workout but it was okay. However.. I had got a little bit hyped after. Now I feel so horrible again. The gym is closed and I lost a lot of  my progress :( All those hard work of grinding 4-5am in the gym daily for years and covid fucks it all up. Man . I gotta eat properly though. thats very tough with depression. If I get enough protein in daily, enough calories, it will set myself up to keep working out. Deep down i know i am a savage. Otherwise I would not still be alive. I want to do amazing things in life like triathlons/MMA/compete in powerlifting at a high level. I am a prospect in life, barely even started. Everyone else is ahead. Depression is such a tough obstacle. But IF I don't ever workout or do anything positive for myself, I become dangerously suicidal. So if i want to stay alive i gotta keep working out"
1908,depression,Can‚Äôt support my depressed roommate cause I am depressed,"My roommate, also my ex bf and my BFF, got really depressed this year. Some 4.5 years ago he got me out of suicidal, horrible depression. But I never truly stopped being depressed. It‚Äôs more like walking depression for me. 

He used to help me. Now he got depressed, I want to help him but instead I feel completely wrong-footed without his support and I fail repeatedly at helping him. I feel like an awful person and I feel guilty for his depression. Maybe my depression sucked all the juices out of him. Or maybe my affairs (after we broke up but while we continued sharing a room) did. 

I just feel like such a complete waste of space, his time and energy, and an excuse for human being because I cannot get myself to stop being depressed. 

The actual reason why he is depressed is Covid and college. He did not graduate on time while I did, and he was barely coping with his courses since the online format is just awful, draining and inhumane. 

The reasons why I was and am depressed are abusive relationships and rape when I was a teen, immigration, the city I live in and a fear of coming back to the country I am from due to potential political persecution there as well as classes and deadlines before I graduated."
1909,depression,I don‚Äôt think having friends is meant for me.,"This may be a little long, so I do apologize in advance.

All of my life, I‚Äôve tried to fit in. My father never wanted me; he left before I was even born. My mom never really had time for me, so I kind of just retreated into myself or played with siblings if they felt like it. From a young age, I knew I was wired differently. I always clung to people. If I met someone new and liked them, they immediately became my friend and I saw a ‚Äúforever‚Äù with them. The problem is, we all know that some people aren‚Äôt meant to stay in our lives forever. I know it, yet somehow a part of me tries to make it permanent. I feel everything so intensely. There‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äúnot serious‚Äù or ‚Äúnot a big deal‚Äù because in my brain, everything is serious, even when I don‚Äôt want it to be or think it shouldn‚Äôt be.
I never really felt like I fit in with any group of friends I had. I was just... there. Like a picture on the wall you glance at but never really see.

Fast forward to now. I‚Äôm 25. I‚Äôm still having a hard time making and keeping friends. There‚Äôs a person that‚Äôs been in my life for years. In the beginning, we talked every day for hours. A lot had changed since then. He had a child and just has a lot on his plate. (My mental state is terrible at the moment, so unfortunately I‚Äôm having a hard time with employment and just life in general.) But I‚Äôm so used to us talking every single day because that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs always been. I asked him the other day why he never talks to me. He said I was taking it way too personal and that he doesn‚Äôt intentionally do it. I feel like an inconvenience to everyone around me, even my boyfriend of almost 5 years. He‚Äôs so loving and truly the best thing that has ever happened to me. But I feel like I bother him too. I feel like I bother everyone just by existing. That‚Äôs pretty much it.

If you read all that, thank you so much."

I have good days and bad days, but there are days when my loneliness brings me to my knees and I stop whatever I'm doing, crawl back into bed, hug my pillow and cry myself to sleep, all whilst I have this horrible butterfly feeling in my heart, and I wouldn't wish that feeling on my worst enemy or the people that I blame for my lonliness. 

The reason I'm posting is because I get that same awful, hopeless feeling when I read the things posted in this sub and it pains me to see people feeling so lost and hopeless. Seeing peoples troubles makes me scared for the future because I know that in 10 years time, I'll still be alone, crying myself to sleep and have that decaying feeling in my heart.

I'm not sure what the purpose of this post is, sometimes I use reddit to express what I'm feeling, and was just curious if anyone knows the feeling I'm talking about or can relate. Please don't take offence to me saying I get scared seeing other peoples posts and problems because it's not my intent to cause trouble or upset anyone. 

Never let anyone make you feel selfish, guilty, or make out that you're just seeking attention, because your feelings and experiences are valid, and fuck anyone that tries to make you feel bad or doubt yourself for feelings and experiences that are completely out of your control. It's not your fault you're hurting, and I hope one day you can look back on these times and smile because you know that the worst in behind you. ‚ù§"

1917,depression,a little of where I am tonight...," I (22F) have been depressed for as long as I can remember; I am not writing to speak of my many problems. There is just a particular 'thing' that has been bothering me for a few days and I think it is best to start there. I am not someone to easily open up, and have always been choosy with my words. Recently someone on a dating site had reached out to me. I get a decent amount of people messaging me since I do not struggle in the looks department, but I always drop conversations because they are never interested in actual conversation. It's gotten to the point that I don't even bother anymore. I guess recently I have been feeling alone because I decided to answer some of the messages. I told one of the dudes that I was conversing with that I would go on a date with him when I finished school in a few weeks, he seemed shocked that I would go out with him and we immediately exchanged socials. On my social he started to reveals his true intentions by messaging me things like, ""I'm horny"". Usually I would just block someone like that but instead I explained to him that I would not talk to him that night then since that is not the direction I want to go with someone I have not known for even 5 hours. The next day I was messaging him while at school; just asking random things like what hobbies or aspirations he has which he could barely respond to. He then asked me if I could do him a favor since he was having a bad day. The favor was for me to send him a booty pic. I just blocked him.

 Side note: I know that some of you touched-starved people would be mad at me for that; but please understand that a shoe doesn't fit all sizes. I have been groped before and lied to because of people's inability to think beyond their desires and not be able to see me as fully human because of sex appeal that I do not give a damn about.

 Back to the topic: after blocking this guy I went back and read another guy's message, who I was certain would follow the same routine as everyone else. Strangely he never did anything to offend me as we texted each other for a couple days; we even exchanged numbers (which is something I never do). As he texted me I noticed that he was careful with his words and I appreciated that. He later asked me why I picked him and I said that I liked his emotional intelligence and talking with him was fun, and he likewise felt the same about me. For the first time I felt like I was actually connecting with someone that I found ideal. After a couple days I noticed that the messaging was starting to dry. It felt like he was trying to fade. I gave a few more puffs to the exhaust of the conversation until he completely ignored the last message I sent two days ago.

 I guess where my problem lies is in wanting a genuine connection, and feeling so close to it too to just find out it is a mirage in a dry desert."

1921,depression,Ketamine therapy process feelings,"Hi. Recently I tried ketamine therapy once at clinic by intravenous injection. It lasted about a hour, and I feeled like in true psychodelic trip. I'm not sure, but seems that I got 0.5mg/kg dosage. But later I got some problems with this clinic, and by the way it's too expensive.

So, I read famous post on reddit about ketamine and depression. Researcher wrote that ""sad person"" can insufflate same 0.5mg/kg each 10 minutes 5 times to recieve positive antidepressive effect. Which I did. And during this procedure I didn't feeled anything unusual, just as reasearched said.

1923,depression,Can somebody comment anything please?,"Seriously there are too much on my plate... I've been struggling as long as I remember but this is just beyond my level. If this isn't the hell, I don't know what is.

Depression, social anxiety, suicidal thoughts, I lost my friend and my long time crush 3 days ago at the same time, one of my the other friend told me something bad to me which is my fault, my parents are on the verge of divorce, I have a tons of assignments to do, mid term is just around the corner, no goal nothing just nothing to look forward to...

I tried, I mean I really tried. I've started taking antidepressants last summer, seeing therapist, tried riding a bicycle etc but this is all I got?

Is it really selfish to end this life with all of these? Seriously? You call it selfish? No, I don't think so, even if I were being called ""selfish"", I would end this life for my sake."

life has gone downhill and i hate it. my best friend and i stopped talking and hanging out for some reason and i just miss him. i got into a relationship and then suddenly it felt like we weren‚Äôt friends anymore. the relationship is good for me and it‚Äôs healthy, but due to my own mental health i have some serious communication issues and can get frustrated easily sometimes and be a little sensitive for some reason. i love him and he loves me and it‚Äôs been very good but i just feel like since then, my life has somehow gone to absolute shit in all other areas and i just feel so fucking lonely all the time. my boyfriend is very encouraging and says stuff like ‚Äúwell get through it‚Äù and i wish that‚Äôd make me feel better but it doesn‚Äôt for some reason and i still feel so fucking alone. i wish i knew what was wrong with me. i wish i didn‚Äôt lose my closest friend. i just miss being happy. i miss feeling ok."
1926,depression,"Not poetry, but still something I wish I could cry aloud","I love the Snowfall, her frigid white visage streaked with pain.

I‚Äôd loved the sun once, but no more. My Snowfall looked to me and sighed, leaving our somber waltz. The sun broke her down, and taking her from me and putting her in the sky to be hers again. She left my heart to burn. I should be angry, but I cannot muster that. I‚Äôm too weak, too weak to acknowledge how the Snowfall let me love, and let me die. But I don‚Äôt blame the Snowfall. The sun owns her, and I? I‚Äôm the cold dead, I have no stake, no claim. I‚Äôm the hollowness I wish I‚Äôd snuffed out long ago. And maybe one day, I will.

1929,depression,Torment,"It seems my world is falling apart. No clear direction for life to take me. Seeing my finances dwindle along with my hope, until all is left is a small ember until that too is put out and everything becomes darkness.

Waking up at ungodly hours noticing the world around me is dead. Which step do I take when everything is chaos.

Afflicted indecision and the villain of time. If I don't do something drastic now, like move abroad, change my surroundings, then I may not get the chance as I'm almost 30. I fear the sacrifice that would have to be made--family, my cat, my culture.

I've slept in the same clothes for a few days now. I haven't changed into anything. My dirty laundry sits there as a reminder of my messed up life. It also symbolizes the boulder in the Myth of Sisyphus that must be rolled up a hill only for it to fall back down and have to be pushed again. Camus thought Sisyphus might've found meaning in the struggle; for me, I don't see it. I see the arbitrariness of life and having to repeat such cycles of suffering (eg: work).

My hair is unruly but I don't want to go to the barber. I'd rather stay at home and not have the anxiety of having to show the face of despair in public. If there is someone you shouldn't invite to parties, it's definitely me. I'll ruin your party and give you an existential crisis as well.

My glasses are kind of broken which means I can't drive to the optician to get them fixed. I woke up close to 7pm so the optician wasn't even open, nor could I take a bus to get there anyway. Instead, I spend my time on reddit alone and in darkness. For the past months, indeed I have lived in torment."
1930,depression,What's there to say?,"Honestly guys. There really ain't much to say. Depression is so common and depression in men is also coming to light daily. There are more resources uploaded daily on how to handle depression and I think we are in a age where there's more help than ever.   


Everyday I try to improve myself. Become a better version of myself. I have come to accept things. I have learnt that not everything is in your control. And that is fine. When I talk to people they say I am wise. Experienced. I know life is not perfect and I want to make the best out of it. I won't say that I have a horrible past, but I have been in some bad situations and places in my life. But I am in a better position than I have ever been. A great opportunity that makes my whole future secure. Amazing people that always supports me. Life is amazing!  


Then why. Why is it that I still wake up depressed in the morning. Lose motivation by just opening my eyes. This feeling of loneliness just creeping in and telling me stay away from everyone. My will just crashing, my anxiety flaming me. I start overthinking everything again. Start playing future conversations in my head, preparing for the worst. I start pitying myself. And with the combination of all of this, I start hating myself.   


I am sure I am not the only one."
1931,depression,My Ex got married.,"Fuck its been over two years and I can't fucking feel any better. She dumped me for him. She's was so much of what I loved and everything has been so much worse since I lost her.

She moved to Germany with the intention of me following a few months later. Lo and behold she finds someone new. She dumps me and they are dating right away. Why did she have to treat me so terribly when I did nothing to deserve that? Why do I still love her so much after all this?

Now I find out she married him. We're young. I thought I had a few years before I ever had to mentally prepare myself for this. I think its a ""greencard"" marriage so she can travel back to Germany with the pandemic but it doesn't matter. She loves him.

I haven't found any women attractive since I started dating her so I can't just find someone else. We also knew each other since we were kids so no one else I'll ever meet will know me so deeply. I just want to stop existing at this point."

1935,depression,I don‚Äôt have anybody who really cares,"It‚Äôs my own fault. I go through periods where I don‚Äôt pick up the phone to call my mom, and I won‚Äôt see my friends for months at a time. I can‚Äôt work at a real job because within six months of getting hired it all goes up in a fiery blaze when I start no-showing and getting high at home instead. My boyfriend says he doesn‚Äôt want kids with me because I‚Äôd be a bad mom. I‚Äôd be a good house wife though I guess. I‚Äôm pretty sure he only keeps me around as his personal drug and sex dispensary since I can offer literally nothing else to him.

Everyone has given up on me. My parents don‚Äôt call, or respond to my texts. All my aunts and uncles stopped trying to have a relationship with me. My closest friend doesn‚Äôt consider herself close with me anymore. I guess I should try to be grateful, because the less people who love me, the less I‚Äôm capable of hurting.

I don‚Äôt have the motivation or will within me to feel anything but exhaustion. I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm so lonely. This is gonna die in new with the rest of the cries for help, but I think I‚Äôm just hoping one person might have heard me and understood. 

Maybe I don‚Äôt deserve to be heard. Maybe nobody can understand it because I‚Äôm so wrong. But I can‚Äôt change it anymore. The person I was who had the ability to adapt and move forward doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. All I can do is mimic the same movements I‚Äôve been making for years. I‚Äôm so fucking tired of it."
1936,depression,"Hi uhhh, what in the ever loving fuck is wrong with me :)","Hello I'm an 18F ( I'm sorry if I suck at this I'm new to reddit) and the point of this post is to vent and to ask if I'm a spoiled brat who's sad cause I'm not used to the big outside world or if im sad cause something is wrong with me.

I started uni bout a month and a bit ago. Im going to the uni I wanted to and doing the courses I choose and was actively excited to do. I'm living away from home for the first time in a halls of residence and luckily due to living in new Zealand and having amazing parents I have first year free with no loans needed. I've made new friends there and am keeping up with my studies.

It's literally the most someone could ask for in life and I realize how privelleged I am to have this opportunity. What I don't understand is why the fuck I'm so sad. I feel like I have two separate sides in my head the miserable one and the sane side.

The miserable one isn't capable with logical thinking. Doesn't understand that each day you just gotta get through the day or week and not worry so far into the future like next year. This part of me punches it's way through the sane side with overwhelming dread, that I'll never be anything in life, that I'm a disappointment to my family and really I'm just wasting everyones time and money by being around. This side has thought about jumping off the fucking building I live on for gods sake. I don't think I would ever do it cause I'm to much of a scaredy cat to do so but it really scares me sometimes.

The sane side of me, the person who's writing this post right now thinks that miserable side should shut the fuck up and go away. There are other people in the world with it way worse than you, you are wasting the privellege you have by being sad all the time.

You see it's always been this way since I was younger but never this bloody frustrating. I'll be walking back from a cells lecture feeling good about what I've done and my brain will go "" yeah but you still haven't started that ecology report due in a month or what about the geology paper huh, your really just gonna fail this year, be a disappointment to mum and dad ( I love my parents alot they have been the best parents I could possibly ask for) and be a waste to this world"". It breaks me every time and , though I loathe to admit it, crying usually insues. 

I just want to be normal. So I'm using reddit to vent, sorry. I don't want to talk to my parents or friends cause I'll be wasting there time with some stupid whining from a teenage girl. They don't need to be concerned over some stupid hormones or first years stress I'm going through. I don't even know if this is the right place to post it cause depression is a serious mental illness and I'm just confused. I just want to know if anyone at all read through that cluster fuck of a reddit post and I just being sad and crying because I'm a spoiled brat or because there's something wrong with me."

1944,depression,My dad,"I get a lot of people telling me how toxic my dad is and how abusive he is and how I need to run as far away from him as possible and call the cops. I'm kinda tired of it so I'm addressing it now. Though my dad was a very different man in my childhood he's gotten far better as I've grown and matured. My dad is an amazing and loving man and when I'm with him I genuinely feel at peace and just like I'm home. I dont come by that sort of feeling a lot so I'm very grateful to him for providing that even though he doesn't know it. He cares about me and my siblings deeply and I know that he loves us. My father is a good man. End of story. Just because someone made poor decisions in their past doesn't mean that they're not capable of change. I hope this clears some things up.

(If this makes no sense to you its probably because you haven't read some of my older posts about my father so if you'd like you can do that but it doesn't matter much to me)"
1945,depression,I thought I was already past it. But then it came back,"I was dutifully taking my meds. ""Was"" being the keyword here, as it ran out last week. Since I've been taking my meds for 1 whole year, I thought 1 week of no meds while I wait for a restock was no biggie. Boy, was I way off. Apparently without it,  my symptoms came back at full force almost immediately.
Just because i had a bad week, I immediately thought it was a nice life while it lasted. Those ideations became plans in a heartbeat. I have enough self-awareness to realize things are definitely going downhill fast. But knowing what you need to do and feeling if you are up to it are two completely different things. I can't believe I'm this weak-willed. Which kinda reinforces my preconceived notions that the world is better off without me. I know I shouldn't feel this way, but I can't help it. I feel like my support system turned against me. Coincidentally, they're having a bad week, too. Is it too selfish of me to think they should've taken my side at least despite the fact that they're not having a good time, too? I know that the world doesn't revolve around me, but it'd be nice to know that someone backs me up."
1946,depression,I haven‚Äôt been feeling ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù or ‚Äúsadness‚Äù lately,"It‚Äôs been a few months since I lost an uncle to suicide. After going through so many emotions all at once I feel as though my brain is just tired. I catch myself fantasizing about killing myself and it just makes me sick. So many people (friends and family) are depending on me to help them be okay and I haven‚Äôt had any time to relax or reflect on myself. I‚Äôm so tired of feeling empty and drained, and I know whatever bad feeling you all have you are tired of it too. I know it doesn‚Äôt mean much but we made it through today and we‚Äôll do it again tomorrow :)"
1947,depression,A woman being scared of me has been making me cry uncontrollably for the past hour,"(Might not be important but I‚Äôm a black male, 20, only 5‚Äô10 but I‚Äôm kinda muscular) I was walking back to my apartment and a girl around my age saw me enter the building and looked visibly nervous (not in a good way lol) and honestly I don‚Äôt blame her. I live in a university area so there‚Äôs a lot of gross dudes around for sure and a lot of sex crimes are reported and not taken seriously by law enforcement which is appalling. Anyway I was just experiencing a lot of subtle racism and just general ignorance from people around me and this just kinda hit me there lol. It‚Äôs kinda dumb but I know a lot of other men experience this and I hope we can eventually treat each other with respect and dignity so this doesn‚Äôt have to happen anymore.

TL;DR: Shit interaction, girl scared of me because men have been raping, me hurt cuz I don‚Äôt do that and felt bad I made her scared."
1948,depression,Being told to excersise when I already can't get out of bed makes me feel so much worse,"When I'm having a good day this advice absolutely rings true and I feel so much better for getting out and stretching my legs. When I'm having a bad day the idea of going for a run is so unrealistic that it reminds me of just how fucking useless this illness has made me. If it's taken me until 2pm to get out of bed and the idea of brushing my teeth feels overwhelming then even going for a walk is going to be too much. Whilst I understand at times it's the right advice, by the time it's got to the stage that someone is offering me it it's already too late and just makes me feel shittier."
1949,depression,it's ultimately better to not get attached,"after losing almost everyone I care about last year, being basically completely on my own and unable to hold a job for pretty much all of the last year (while living off of covid relief) one thing this pandemic has taught me is to not be attached, attachment leads to hope and hope ultimately leads to disappointment, there are no lasting achievements in this life (whether it's a job, relationships or even academic pursuits) nothing lasts for long and you lose so much more than you win so its better to not let yourself care enough for it to be a loss in the first place, hope is the biggest lie we tell ourselves so it's better not to be fooled by it at all"

He is one of those people who try to make the other person look like the bad guy. This was my first mistake, i was receiving death threats left and right and only one person was talking to me like she kinda cared but then she blocked me too.

have even stopped going to family gatherings because only thing I do is sit there and act like a target dummy for people to throw shit at to fill the void between topics,  always ignored when I speak, literally any topic about me is always just negative shit about how I am,  childhood topic=disgusting neglect no one cared about,  adult topic=socially retarded with 0 chances of getting a bright future.  
think this ultimately has led to why im so isolated and can barely function anymore,  ive missed out on countless oppertunities to get a really good and solid career because I just don't know how to speak or act for people to not treat me like a dog.  
No degree,  no job,  no real friends and no social skills whilst everyone else in my family are successful people with children whilst running their own business and being politicans etc.  
went to dinner for easter yesterday with my family and broke down for the first time ever in front of them after being insulted as usual and went home, no one has even asked me why or how i feel 24 hours after it happened.

As part of my final year project, I'm devising a system to analyse depression and depression levels among various individuals based on a sample of their video data. However, the system needs a sufficient amount of samples for it to properly train itself and identify distinguishing characteristics among each level. And we currently don't have enough volunteers to get that many samples. 

All we need is a video sample of you while answering a short 21-point questionnaire. For that purpose, I'll schedule a Zoom meeting in which I'll give the questionnaire and record your video while attempting. The meeting will hardly last 10-15 minutes of your time.

Now, you might've some concerns regarding privacy of your data. But don't worry, *your data won't be made public in any manner whatsoever. It'll only be used for research and analysis purposes.* As an individual, I understand your concerns and I can assure you of the same.

If you'll like to volunteer, you can fill in the following link (*This form is only for contact purposes to schedule the Zoom meeting. The data in it won't be recorded or used for any type of analysis. Your name and other details will remain anonymous*).

1964,depression,"I'm on a Temporary Work Trip and I'm Getting Depressed, Anxious, and Homesick","I (26m) am on a trip as a sub-contractor outside of my home state. I took this job to make money as I was having issues with my finances, living paycheck to paycheck. I work late at night and into the early morning with a team of 25 (give or take) people. I'm staying in an AirBNB with some co-workers until the contract is up. I usually live alone. The contract ends in 3 weeks and if I finish it I'll have some decent money to work with.  


I had to leave behind a cat whom I love dearly and is being cared for by my brother. I'm anxious that he will hate me or won't be as bonded to me when I return. I'm weirded out by the people I've met here; some of them are too unambitious for me. I'm anxious about getting hurt on the job. Not because of the pain, but because I have no insurance and there is no worker's compensation; it's triggered fears of being maimed and being unable to create or teach art. I want to go home, but also want the money as a launch pad for the rest of the year. I'm not someone who likes to quit, yet I do all the time. I'm trying to break the cycle. I don't believe that my mental health is an excuse to rid my life of challenges or responsibilities. The town we are working in is weird, flat, industrial, and smells like garbage. The people here make me uncomfortable and I've had a few nightmares, but a few okay dreams too (it should be noted, I've been off weed for just over 3months now.)  


I just feel trapped. I know I am doing this as a means to an end and that the contract will end soon. I just desperately want it to be over right now. I am sick of quitting efforts when they get too hard. I'm a religious person so I frequently pray for strength and courage. This is different than being ""stuck in a job"" as this is a contract gig I got through a friend who is managing the whole project. I'm aware that there is a list of external factors that are making me feel this way in conjunction with my personal traumas and mental traits.  


I've been diagnosed with Anxiety &amp; ADHD. Depression kinda comes in fluctuations, but my usual mode allows for hope and laughter and joy. I currently do not have access to therapy.

I know they weren‚Äôt my dogs but I just feel so down, I cried my eyes out the other day when I found out about the second dog and now I just can‚Äôt pick my mood back up, I feel exhausted and on the verge of a panic attack and just really down.

That I was good looking, and it was really nice to talk to me.

That maybe I wasn't seeing the people interested in me because of this low self-esteem.

So, real question. Why in fucking years, nobody asked to see me ? Why nobody reached me first ? Why am I always the one who ask to see people ?

Why I can only remember one time, and litteraly, one time in years, where someone actually wanted me to come ?

How the fuck do you expect me to have some kind of self-esteem when nobody reach me ? When I'm always the one who ask ?

1988,depression,day 3,"today still sucked, but the misery laid low so i was able to enjoy myself today. i hope this spells the end of a depressive period, and just in time for me to get everything back on track. and maybe it's too the first step in teaching myself that i can live without it.

it's insidious, though. that's the first step in how it gets you again. you think ""oh i'm happy now, i can make something of my life now, i can be real now"" and then IT GETS YOU. you start doubting yourself for being unable to handle simple tasks; physical fatigue will wrack your body and mind; and then the tide sweeps you away once it comes back in.  i can't let myself be fooled into thinking i can handle everything like before. it brings me no joy but i'll be the lazy bastard it makes me into and guilts me for being, and i'll strangle it much the same way it strangles me.

how hard it'll be to be that lazy bastard once i get back into college though. education slows down for nobody i've found, and it'll punish you hard for the slightest misstep. it goes hand in hand with misery, waking up sleep-deprived and forcing yourself past your abilities to copy information day in day out. as cruel as it is to admit to myself, it takes higher priority over my own wellbeing. it's mostly the depression saying that i bet.

four days now, time to get my sleeping pattern in check. if i have any modicum of discipline, this'll be the last all nighter i pull for a long time. i'd better enjoy the sleep."

1. Suggest some books for my friend so that he could relate and understands his condition and may be get ready to seek help
2. Some good centers in India where he can go to seek said help."

1992,depression,Great... just fucking fantastic,"First my parents separate. Not divorced yet but plan on it. I get ""over it"". Still hurts like hell but I finally accepted it. My dad got a new girlfriend and I try to be as accepting as possible. I figure its a bit fast but hey people move on at different rates yada yada whatever. Then my mom breaks down a while later tells me everything about my dad and her relationship. Not going into details, all you need to know is its really bad. Fucks me up real bad but I pull myself up by the boot straps for the time being to comfort my mom cause she's in tears. I cry all night. Feel like I can't trust my dad. My mom realizes her mistake, calms me down tomorrow morning cause I was so fucked up I couldn't go to school.

Fast forward to now. Talking to my dad again good relationship but I feel awkward as hell around his girlfriend. My grandpa recently was hospitalized due to low hemoglobin count. My dad wanted to visit him and I didn't want to stick around his girlfriends house alone so I came with him and stuck around in his truck. On the ride back I ask him how he's doing and he tears up. I have only ever seen him tear up two other times in my life. When he tried to comfort me when his mom died and when I consistently was failing in school.

He tells me my grandpa won't except the blood transfusion.

He tells me he won't eat.

He tells me that my grandpa figures God will sort him out.

He tells me that he doesn't think he's gonna make it.

I play it tough and try and comfort him because thats how I was taught. It fucks me up bad. Not only has my grandpa been in the hospital two other times but the first time he was in there for two months. He just now started to get back to his original strength. Then he broke his hip and got it replaced. And now this. If he does pull through he's gonna have to rebuild from rock bottom again. My dad is the only person who can see him because of this stupid covid guideline bullshit. Not only can we not see him and show him we love him but he can't get the fucking support from us. I just want to see him before he dies but I can't. I want him to be surrounded by his loved ones to know he is loved. Even if that doesn't change his mind about the transfusion at least he'll die in the support of his loved ones.

Now fast forward to today. My dad calls me and we talk for a bit and I ask about my grandpa. He tells me his hemoglobin count is going up but his kidneys and heart are starting to get worse.

Why. Why me. Why do I have to fucking take hit after God damn hit. Then when all is said and done I don't have the fucking balls to tell anyone how its affecting me until I'm fucking breaking down. I support my mom and dad and see that it's okay to seek help from loved ones but I don't. I guess it's because I don't wanna put that burden on them but just. Fuck. I hate it."

My ears are ringing like crazy, and I can almost feel my brain liquefying. Don't know how much weight I have lost, but my pants keep sliding off my waist. The isolation working inside a windowless research lab in the basement all day, the isolation of this deserted town, the isolation inside the apartment where I live, the isolation of having no family and friends close by - it's turning me into a living zombie.


My family tell me ""prayer is the only way"". People I know tell me ""shit happens, there are other people in worse situations than you, don't worry so much"". My supervisor says ""keep working, deliver more"". To avoid appearing appearing like a whiner to all these people, nowadays I just tell them ""I am doing okay"".

I am not okay. I am pretty far from okay. There are too many uncertainties in front of me that I need to solve in a limited amount of time. Biologically I exist, but mentally I am not all there anymore. I have never felt more lonely in my life.

I never liked school to begin with and being 18-19 at the time I felt like I had to go to not be embarrassed since the rest of my friends were going to the top schools but I didn‚Äôt realize college would absolutely destroy the little bit of happiness I had left.. I dropped out recently after having horrible experiences w rude teachers and students and as somebody who suffers w anxiety and social anxiety I was never a top achiever in classes or even social situations and when it came to school it just made me feel plain stupid.. the students were rude and same with the teachers and the friends I did have would just suffer with me until the weekends came and it was Time to drink or do whatever drug we could (I‚Äôm clean now) and after dropping out during the beginning of the pandemic I had hope maybe I would find something different better to do? But as the pandemic continued and I ended up living the same day over and over and over again I feel as if my life will never take a good turn, I only talk to the same 5 people and half of them I don‚Äôt really think genuinely care for me.. but I‚Äôd rather have shitty friends then be completely alone ( I know terrible mindset) All my friends come and go and it‚Äôs started to make me think.. is it my fault? I‚Äôve never been in a relationship or anything close to that my entire life and I really want to be loved and cared for as as a young woman I can‚Äôt help but feel undesirable and not good enough..  seeing all my friends in love and My anxiety makes me feel like it‚Äôs my fault .. it seems like my life is way harder than everyone else‚Äôs and I‚Äôve come to terms with most likely never being romantically loved by anybody and I want to live a successful happy life but as of right now it feels absolutely impossible with the life that was given to me.. I feel as if I‚Äôm suffering in silence.. helping my friends with their mental struggles and getting little to no type of support in return..

2003,depression,Angry at Therapist,"Forgive me if this isn't the place for it, but I'm at my wit's end and at least need to rant.

Long story short, I never had insurance that provided mental health services, nor could I afford the high price of care. When COVID hit, my mental health dropped to an all time low and finally received care through Medicaid literally after I had already planned to kill myself. I got my therapist in October and we clicked! I was feeling better and felt that I had an outlet. In December, she informed me that she was taking a month off for a much needed vacation to visit her family. In the back of my mind, I was like, ""umm... we're in a pandemic, but cool I guess...""

I scheduled my appointment for January, only to have my appointment cancelled, due to my therapist being sick. I rescheduled for February and same thing. They placed me with another therapist for an appointment in March. I spoke with her and it was honestly the worst therapist I've ever talked to. I'm thinking maybe she doesn't specialize in depression and anxiety. 

Now, I'm at another all time low. I know my therapist will be coming back soon, but they haven't started scheduling appointments yet. 

Okay - So, this pisses me off for a few reasons. For one, she decided to risk her health during a pandemic. Two, I don't know many jobs that are cool with their workers being sick for months and it feels like we're coddling a professional that gets to work from home and simply talk to people over the phone. As someone who was let go during the pandemic, this is irritating. Third, I may be at rock bottom, but I know there are people way worse than me. I feel for them during this struggle without a therapist. We are literally so close to killing ourselves and it feels like the one person whose job is to help us is skipping out because of a sore throat.

Yes, COVID is really bad. But, if you're talking about returning to your work from home job, I'm going to assume you're doing fine and not in life threatening danger.

I feel bad for these thoughts, but I'm genuinely angry, frustrated and very very depressed/anxious. I don't know what to do except to wait until she feels like working again. Hopefully I'm still alive üëç"

2013,depression,Why is my mom always mad at me?,"I grew up with my grandparents since both my parents lived in another place but moved to my place a few years later. I started living with my parents and I didn't like it there. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom calls me names like ""t\*nga"" or ""g\*go""\* everytime I made a mistake or forget something. She also says things about me being stupid just because I can't multiply a three digit problem in 3 seconds and whenever I want to visit my grandma's other relatives like my aunt or cousins, she would lock me in my room and threaten to cut my tongue, she also broke my wrist in 2nd grade and I had to lie to the school clinic even if I want to say that my mom broke it.

 I want to tell her that she hurts my feelings and that she can't expect me to be perfect but she always wants to be the one who's right because ""moms know best"" or something. She wants to be seen as the victim of all these things when she's the one who's been hurting me and called me words. Sometimes I just wished she wasn't my mom, I am upset that she had me at 16 years old and I don't know why she treats me like that, I already helped her with things, gave up everything to make her happy and yet she gets very mad when I accidentally make a mistake like whenever we travel, I remember one time I was around 7 to 10 years old I had to carry the luggages to the conveyer belt looking thing in the airport and she threatened to leave me in the airport if I don't hurry. 

Or whenever there's a turbulence in the plane and my food and drinks fall on me, she would secretly pinch me hard when that happens. My great-grandma also accidentally burnt my finger with a candle and obviously my reaction would be shocked but sadly my dear mom glared daggers at me for doing that reaction. What am I gonna do? Smile for burning my finger? Sorry for ranting I might sound like a jerk but...

&amp;#x200B;

Why does my mom blame me over anything and gets mad at me easily??? How do I fix this problem?

2014,depression,I need help.," 

Short  back story, I used to drink heavily (12 or so beers per day) didn't  matter the time of day. I went to work, etc..high functioning alcoholic  for sure. Then one day I experienced my first ever panic attack, went to  the ER ... everything fine of course.

Fast  forward 3 years and I struggle with anxiety daily, but not panic. I'm  able to shop alone, go to work fine, fall asleep fine.

My issue is I can NEVER feel happy or relaxed. My anxiety attack a few years ago kickstarted some depression I feel like.

I  turn to beer, but only 2-4 cans..BUT just about daily. Not to help with  anxiety so much, but depression...boredom...maybe both? Social anxiety  for playing games? I'm a mess basically.

My  question, what can I do to help feel more relaxed and not so paranoid  for no reason. Any herbal teas or anything? I want to avoid medicine  because I feel like I'm not at a severe level for that, but I also want  to avoid beer. Sorry I have been drinking so this post may be all over  the place."
2015,depression,how do i stop feeling like i dont deserve anything good,"im a full time college student doing two majors at a top ten university in the us, and i have ocd, depression, anxiety, and arfid. i have been struggling recently with trying to keep up my self care and giving myself breaks when i need it in my busy schedule. this time of year is also normally when i relapse into bad depressive episodes so its been rough. every time i give myself a break i always seem to forget an assignment or fuck something up like forgetting an appointment time or not preparing for a test enough. i always feel like there are direct failures correlated with when i give myself breaks to do things i enjoy, and i also feel like life has been hitting me with one shitty situation after another the last month. im struggling a lot with feeling like i deserve to do anything good for myself. ive been having bad self harm urges and i just feel like i need to punish myself for fucking up. doing less is not an option because i dont deserve to give myself any more breaks. i feel really stuck and i just want to punish myself for being such a bad person"

2017,depression,My reason not to became the only reason i wanted to,"I was in a really close knit group. But one of the people in the group was my absolute best friend. She was like a sister to me. She knew and knows me better than anyone. I told her everything, she told me everything. We spent almost every single day together and I‚Äôll say until i die that i made my best memories with her. Last summer i had to go away. I was in a really really bad place and basically stopped taking to everyone, started SH, and would sit in bed for days without eating or drinking.  I‚Äôve struggled with mental health in the past, but for some reason this was different. She helped me through it, texting and listening. The only reason i didn‚Äôt act on my daily suicidal thoughts was because I knew she would never forgive herself and I didn‚Äôt want to ruin her. for that i owe her my life. Anyways fast forward to a few months ago, to make a long story short she had apparently been sharing my personal details with people to make fun of me. She went around telling people i was crazy and fragile and a compulsive liar. Said some other really horrendous stuff too. I didn‚Äôt believe it but I saw screenshots snd proof first hand. When i confronted her she just tried to make me feel guilty for being angry. I sobbed for days trying to figure out what to do. I didn‚Äôt want to lose her but I needed to for once in my life choose ME first. I cut her off. I had to. But I‚Äôm a darker place than i‚Äôve ever  been now. I have other friends i‚Äôm not like a loner but the pain just hurts so deep that i‚Äôve kind of distanced myself from everyone again. I barely feel anything anymore. Rooms a mess. Barely showing up for school. No motivation to do assignments.  I never thought she would do this to me. I don‚Äôt know how to trust anyone. I don‚Äôt know what I did wrong. I feel like a joke. And as someone with low self esteem, i can‚Äôt help but internalize all of the things she said about me. I mean she knows me best, right? I wish i could have been better."

2019,depression,Today is the first time I truly came to terms with the fact that I am depressed.,"For a long time I knew I had been going through a ‚Äúrough patch‚Äù life isn‚Äôt perfectly polished. I feel grateful that as a 23 year old I have already been aware of that for a long time. These past 4 or 5 years have just felt different. Everything I have ever enjoyed has suddenly become a chore. I feel incapable of keeping up with my responsibilities only brings me down more. Suicide feels like a more and more viable and peaceful option every day. But worst of all, I. Can‚Äôt. Sleep. Forever I figured ‚Äúsuch is life‚Äù and ‚Äúpart of becoming and adult‚Äùuntil today when something inside of me clicked. After a bit of research that eventually led me here I have come to the realization that, while I am no doctor, I experience a rather long list of things that all point towards being mentally ill. It still feels weird because I never considered myself to be familiar with this. I‚Äôm still not familiar with this but it feels good to begin to recognize that this isn‚Äôt how life should be."
2020,depression,I want to do so many things but I just can't,"I can't even remember the last time that I had motivation to better myself or set myself up for the future. I'm 21(M) and am expecting to graduate college in a year but that means nothing to me because I have basically cheated my way through almost all of it. I feel like I haven't accomplished anything and although I want to accomplish things, I can't bring myself to it. I know generally I'm not really behind, but I feel so behind in terms of finding what I actually want to do with my life. I need an internship but I have no idea what I want to do so I don't even know what to apply for. I feel like I know nothing about my own major too, which makes it even harder to find out what I want. Thinking about it scares me because I just know that I am going to have to figure out what I want to do at some point in order to have a future, but I just keep putting it off because I don't want to face that. I have a part-time job and work 24 hours a week but other than that, I just sit in my room all day, occasionally going out to eat (which is always shitty fast food). I have no confidence in myself and I just beat myself up nonstop and I want to stop but I feel that I deserve whatever thoughts come to me. I feel like I have dug myself into a hole and I have no idea how to get out. I know I have to fix things myself in order to get out of this but I just keep pushing it off because I have 0 motivation. One day I feel fine and content, but the second I start thinking about this, I go back into this hole that is really hard to get out of. For the record, I have recently started weekly therapy in the past month, but I feel I'm not doing what I need to have any change. I haven't done laundry in about a month and I can't bring myself to it even though I know it would make me feel better if I could just do that. I am full of bad habits that I don't know how to break out of.

Well that's all I have to say. Maybe someone will read this but it's likely it will get lost in the rest of the posts. It just feels good to get it out and say whatever I want. Hello if you are reading this"

2026,depression,"Seeing other people being productive and bettering themselves doesn‚Äôt inspire me, it makes me feel worse","Logically I know I have nothing to lose by trying to exercise, read a book, etc. I don‚Äôt even have a good reason as to why I don‚Äôt do it. Best I can come up with is that I simply don‚Äôt have the energy, and I‚Äôve lost so much hope that my future will turn around that I wonder why I would even want to get better? Like what‚Äôs the point? But I know deep down that being productive will distract from this misery and might as well have a nice body and learn a new skill while I‚Äôm on this rock. Seeing my brother having his shit together and doing everything I want to do is really discouraging. The old me would take it as a challenge, I‚Äôd strive to be the ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù sibling and would work harder. Now I just accept that everybody is always gonna like him better and be more impressed with him so why bother trying? I guess it‚Äôs a prime example of learned helplessness. But it‚Äôs not benefitting me at all. I just always feel like if I try and then fail, I‚Äôll end up feeling even worse about myself. It‚Äôs almost better to be stuck in my depressive episodes than to have a few good days and immediately fall off."
2027,depression,I'm (18/M) a freshman in university. I hate my life.,"I need some serious advice. I'm a freshman in a pretty well respected university in Canada. I hate every aspect about my life right now. I know being online isn't a good representation of how university really is, but I've always hated school. 

I‚Äôve had one previous depressive episode where a psychologist concluded that I had mild clinical depression. It was after having to retire early from hockey at 16 y/o due to injury. I had loved hockey and might have had a future in. It was heartbreaking and I went through some really awful times. 

In high school I wasn't a good student. I had good grades, but I did the absolute bare minimum to be considered a participating student, and I don't think I studied for more than one or two exams for all of high school. I was fortunate enough to get good grades without having to try. 

Now in university, I'm doing well in in three of my classes, and doing poorly in my fourth. There are classes I can tolerate more than others, but **I hate everything to do with academia and school in general.** Shitty and rude professors, cocky class mates, uninteresting classes that aren‚Äôt motivating. It seriously makes me feel physically sick when I think of school, and I'm not exaggerating that. I don't understand how people can do 4+ years of this. It makes me feel dumb, unimportant and overlooked. I have nothing fulfilling in my life right now. 

I‚Äôll be completely honest, I‚Äôve began smoking weed a lot more. I don‚Äôt let it get in the way of my schoolwork, but it‚Äôs the only way I can escape at the end of the day after a tough day of classes/studying. It‚Äôs kind of worrying me considering I only smoked weed on occasion with friends and now it‚Äôs become a habit. I could just drop out, but I really want a financially successful future. I'm not talking about billionaire rich, but I've seen what having to worry about money has done to people. I don't ever want to worry about money in my life. University, to me, seems like the main way to attain this (at least to me). 

I should also mention the family I come from. My parents didn't force me to go to school, but it was expected of me. My dad has a B.A and an MBA and my mom has a B.A and BFA. They're both well educated individuals, and expected me to follow suit. Also, I'm lucky to have a college fund that my dad started. He has nearly 100k in there between my brother and I. That's a fuck ton of money to devote to someone, only for them to not use it. I don't want to disappoint them. I don't want to rely on them forever. I want to own a house someday. I want to afford to take a nice vacation every once in a while. But, I don't see how I can survive this for another 4+ years. It's mentally torturing me. The stress and anxiety I feel around exams is crippling. The rest of the time is pure anhedonia. 

I plan on finishing my first year at the very least. I've made that promise to myself and my parents and I plan to follow through on it. After that, I don't know what I'm going to do. I really need some guidance right now. Anything can help.

Thank you Reddit."
2028,depression,What's the point,"I mean that in a serious way, not a cliche. I don't understand the point of carrying on when my life sucks this bad. Like I would much rather have eternal nothingness than this life that I'm living right now. Everybody says that it gets better but they've been saying that forever and it hasn't. I think I'm done."
2029,depression,Don‚Äôt know what to do at this point.,"This is my first time posting on Reddit but I feel as if I finally need to get this off my chest and possibly seek help. Some details about myself, I am a teenager, divorced parents, no friends, nothing to do all day.

I‚Äôm not going to say I have depression because I have not been diagnosed yet but each day it seems to get keep getting worse and worse. I have no more motivation or drive for anything, including school. I know that not graduating would limit my future greatly but I just can not find any tiny speck of drive to attend school. Some days I feel normal, recently I‚Äôve been having waves of sadness and suicidal thoughts. 

With the recent COVID restrictions (currently living in California) it has gotten almost 10x worse. I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. I know that if I let this go on I will end up dead at some point. Sorry for the shitty writing I‚Äôm not used to jotting my thoughts and feelings onto a page."
2030,depression,A sad realization,"I was watching Big Bang Theory and this episode had Burt the geologist in it. He said something that stuck with me. He said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have dreams, asleep or in life.‚Äù It hit me hard. I realized I never have either. I wasn‚Äôt raised to be a dreamer. I was raised to work. Never pushed to reach for the stars or even for a hobby. Never encouraged for any of it. Just work. Get a skill and work. Or go to the military. I‚Äôve always lived for others. I have no hobbies. No dreams. No aspirations. I just go with the motions. It‚Äôs a terrible feeling. I‚Äôm not passionate about anything. I don‚Äôt have a single thing I‚Äôm great at. I have interest in so many things but it quickly dies. I just don‚Äôt know how to overcome this. I feel like I failed at life completely. I love the American Dream and I‚Äôm not happy. Home ownership sucks, I live to pay bills, and can‚Äôt stand the suburbs. Did it all for my wife. I love her so much, but I could lose everything else in life and not be phased. I feel like I‚Äôm just waiting to die. I‚Äôm ready for it. Like sooner the better in my opinion. Fuck it. Not suicidal. Just not excited to wake up every day. Not excited for anything anymore. I feel like an empty shell. Like I just exist. What‚Äôs the point anymore?"

I'm starting a new medication because I need energy again and I've been on zoloft for years but it hasn't done anything for me.

2035,depression,I will never be fine.,"I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for 4 years. Largely due to my parents. I'm fine with being an only child, in fact, I wish I would've been normal if that makes sense. My mom is emotionally abusive and my dad just ignores it. I have been to a psychiatric ward before, group therapy, and therapy. It worked until quarantine happened and school started up. Both my parents are Asian immigrants and obviously looking for me to be better than what they wanted to do.

My dad signed me up for an SAT class that I never wanted to attend and when I spoke up both parents thought I wanted to do the class and ignored my feelings. When the class started to offer in-person session, I sat there in class doing a practice and my stomach started to hurt for 3 hours. My stomach repeatedly hurts when I go outside now, I'm even afraid of going outside. I may have agoraphobia or just PTSD from my stomach hurting. When I signed up to go back to school as well, I thought it was over and my stomach started acting up again--but this isn't about my anxiety.

I've been losing motivation for over a month or two, not doing work, almost failing my classes, and ditching classes. The school mailed us a notice that if I skipped anymore classes we would get charged. My parents made a big deal out of this and my mom even came over 2 times just to yell at me for things like not going outside with them, not going anywhere in general and now I'm skipping classes and she hopes I have a labor intensive work to understand why my parents pay so much tax money just to have me skip classes. 

There's a form you have to fill out if you want your child to atten school 4 days a week, and my dad asked for my student ID and I gave it to him. I think he might've signed me up for that. But when my mom came in to give me a yelling, I yelled back and asked them if they wanted me to have a panic attack in school because of my anxiety and my dad yelled back, ""YES!"" All angry. I emailed my counselor to ask if he can change me back to remote again.

I know this is a long text and is a mess. I tried to turn into a ghost Monday, if you catch my drift. I feel like a shell of my former self. I used to be so happy, but I feel like my parents ruined me.

I'm looking for advice or someone to talk too. Either would be appreciated."

2046,depression,the season for long sleeves sweats and sweatpants,"so recently started wearing long sleeves sweats and sweatpants if I were to go out for physio or coffee break. Not that it‚Äôs cold, the weather is perfectly fine about 32 Celsius, very warmly. 

the longs helps to hide the cuts. for the years of depression and all that I‚Äôve faced, I‚Äôve never considered self harm well of course there‚Äôs countless number of times of suicide. and yeah I‚Äôve gotten myself on the watch list... even family lawyers couldn‚Äôt get me out of it - the only way out of it would be death.

anyways, didn‚Äôt know cutting would be such addictive. it works better than medication doing it‚Äôs job to numb my thoughts and pain. not sure if it‚Äôs a good or bad thing but I‚Äôve got low platelet count so I bleed profusely. for instance, before my previous surgery, had to do bleeding time test and the results was equivalent to fail and risky cause the time it takes to get clotted for a tiny cut was longer than a normal person.

still the option of taking my life is on the table. just a matter of when. I‚Äôm still waiting and hoping that me reaching out to those special ones would work. 

*today went for a coffee break at my fav gastronomia branch, the waitress said why was I wearing long sleeves in this hot weather. my response was cause I was a tad feeling cold. what a messed up lie"
2047,depression,"Never changed, probably never will","I stumbled across some old writings of mine from about 6 years ago, and it's the same feelings I have now. Same feelings of hopelessness.

Idk what else to do that I actually can do, but obviously there's nothing left for me to do. Just wait for the inevitable end."
2048,depression,Thought of suicide for the first time,"I‚Äôm typing this in my car in a park. I‚Äôm in my second semester of college and I‚Äôve kinda had depression since the whole quarantine thing happened, but it went away around June. Despite that, I always had depression lingering in the back of my mind. Nothing serious. First semester of college was a breeze, since I do well with online classes. Something changed in the second semester. I started getting shaky at night, I don‚Äôt know why but my body would feel anxious without my brain making it feel anxious. I‚Äôve had to crawl under my bed(it has a bunch of space under there) and kind of build a pillow fort like a 6 year old. I hide down there until the fit is over. I recently became a pledge at a fraternity. I wanted friends, because it was hard to make them at a new place during a pandemic and a frat seemed to be a great place to do that. And I have made great friends, who I hope to be friends with for my whole life. However, that didn‚Äôt fix it. My life didn‚Äôt change, my depression hasn‚Äôt gotten better, it‚Äôs gotten worse. I hung out with them tonight, nothing bad happening to me. I just drank a couple beers and sat on the couch waiting to sober up. I get enjoyment when I‚Äôm drunk but I don‚Äôt wanna be an alcoholic or a drug addict when I‚Äôm older. I‚Äôm already addicted to food, seeing as I have Binge Eating Disorder. As I walked out of the frat house, my brain just thought of it.

‚ÄúJust do it‚Äù

I was repulsed by what I thought, and tried to think of ways to deter my mind from thinking that. ‚ÄúYou have a show that still needs to be finished‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat about the guys at the frat.‚Äù It worked until I started driving. At a stop sign, I legitimately thought to myself: ‚Äúdrive in front of the oncoming car. Hopefully it‚Äôll end it.‚Äù I‚Äôm mortified of getting back on the road. I pulled over in a park and don‚Äôt want to get on the road until the thoughts pass. I‚Äôm good now but I I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm sorry, this was just a rant"

people are just like ‚Äúoh, loosing pets suck‚Äù but i don‚Äôt know, feels like he was more then just my ‚Äúpet‚Äù. he was family and my best friend. 

he was still very healthy too. he was probably going to live at least another 4 years. i was worrying about if he‚Äôd be sad or miss me when i left for college in a year or so. but i guess i don‚Äôt have to worry about that anymore because my stupid neighbors refuse to keep their fucking dog in their yard."

Once the quarantine was over I had zero will power to go back to work and ended up getting fired. I‚Äôve been without a job for 2 months now. Have yet to tell my girlfriend or family I have been fired. Only have one more month on my apartment lease. Going to have to break the news that I‚Äôm unemployed and a piece of shit. Can‚Äôt wait to be living at home with my parents at the age of 28. I‚Äôm not sure what my gf will think of it after this. I literally have to act like I‚Äôm at work so she thinks I still have a job. I never thought I would put myself in such a deep hole. I have zero motivation to do anything. I can‚Äôt even enjoy playing video games anymore. I wake up everyday and just sit in my computer chair till 5am. Been doing that for 2 months now. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm letting so many people down. I can‚Äôt do it anymore.
2055,depression,I don't expect to survive this year,"It's not even sickness related. I have Savings to last me until June, and then I will end up homeless. I can't find a job, so I can't afford to live anywhere past June. I won't even have enough money to move back to my dad, so I will just end up on the streets here. I'll probably kill myself soon after that. I am deathly afraid of people and I could never bring myself to get ""help""."
2056,depression,Coming to a close,"Well in the grand scheme of things , i didn‚Äôt accomplish a whole lot . That‚Äôs okay I‚Äôve made peace with that. I just wanted to put my story out there for someone to read.

I was born to a loving mother and father, I was the third , two older sisters . I had a great childhood . My father and I would go to Hastings every Friday and get movies for the weekend . My father would always make these delicious cinnamon rolls every Christmas.my mother would make the most delicious food and she was the most kind and caring mother I could‚Äôve ever asked for. 

I had an aunt who I would go over to her house and she and I would watch tv and bake bread . I miss her still to this day. She passed away in 2015 of leukemia. One of my biggest regrets is not seeing her one last time before she died .

After she died I started dealing with depression , and it never went away. I‚Äôm now 18 and I‚Äôm planning on ending my life soon. Thinking back I can say without hesitation I‚Äôve had a great life . I just don‚Äôt want to be here anymore. 

I‚Äôm not quite sure how to end this long but short story of my time here. But I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll find what I‚Äôm looking for wherever I end up . Thank you if you‚Äôve read this far. I wish you the best

Goodnight"
2057,depression,I need something,"My girlfriend of two years just told me today that she‚Äôs not sure if she want to be with me anymore. She‚Äôs says the love is there but that I am not there for her. This is the person that I have been relying on for so long. When her aunt died I wasn‚Äôt there for her, instead I bitched about my life. She‚Äôs been There for me every fucking day and I can‚Äôt take a moment and be there for her. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck I am doing with my life. I don‚Äôt know what trajectory it‚Äôs taking and to top it all of she‚Äôs leaving, for grad school while I  am still here in school for another 2.5 years because of my short comings. I feel alone. I feel lost and afraid. I don‚Äôt feel like a man, and I just want to call my mom. I am in a shit ton of debt and I am not sure what to do. I feel like have to finish my degree and get the fuck out of here. But my heart is broken. I am not sure how I can handle my life with out her. She made the effort worth it. I want to give her the best life out there. I apologize if I am rambling but I don‚Äôt know what else to do. My mind is wandering and it‚Äôs no where good. I want a break. I don‚Äôt want to kill myself but I don‚Äôt want to keep living this way. How can I show her I care enough to change how can I prove it before she leaves. I have never loved anyone more, and now I lost it. I lost the one good thing going for me. FUCK. What am I suppose to do!!!! I can pause this shit. I can‚Äôt think. I feel stuck and I can‚Äôt do anything!"
2058,depression,Remember when crying was a thing?,"Being able to feel sorrow enough that it builds up inside, and the feeling of some type of relief just letting it all out? I knew it was gonna get worse but holy shit."
2059,depression,"Kinda done with life, but feeling completely normal about it","Hey!

Just writing her for something of an outlet. I‚Äôm 23 years old and kind of at a rut in life. It kind of all feels like a rut. I‚Äôve had it tough, but you know, there‚Äôs always someone who has it worse. Some of my suffering was earned, some not, and it‚Äôs all relative anyway. But I can‚Äôt for the life of me find some reason to live. I don‚Äôt want it. None of it.

I feel like society has taken me hostage. I‚Äôm to work diligently and suffer quietly, or be a financial burden on the rest and suffer as much or more. I don‚Äôt want the human experience. I don‚Äôt want the potential ends. I guess I‚Äôm ungrateful to it, or perhaps the human experience is just something for monkeys. Whichever way, society won‚Äôt give me access to an easy way out. I can‚Äôt decrease my suffering, or the suffering of those who process my corpse. It won‚Äôt give my family and acquaintances the calming and sympathetic framework to understand and respect that life is only worth living if you want it, and that death would bring me the most peace. It won‚Äôt even let me be remembered for who I am, it‚Äôll be pronounced cowardice, like they‚Äôre aware that life is some kind of imprisonment.

I hope there‚Äôs no afterlife, no rebirth, nothing. I hope the world will some day be moral enough to offer a tranquil way out for anyone who wants it."
2060,depression,"I‚Äôm not a failure, but I still want to die","I‚Äôm in my early 20‚Äôs, graduated with a bachelor‚Äôs degree, self-sufficient with a steady job, and have a boyfriend of 2.5 years. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a failure, but I‚Äôm still so indifferent about being alive. My life is on a good track, but I still feel completely indifferent about my existence continuing. I‚Äôve wracked my brain, but there‚Äôs honestly nothing I look forward to about my life. Living is such a chore. Advice on how to find something that makes me not want to be dead is appreciated.

Edited to add: or honestly, I‚Äôd just love to hear from others who might be in a similar place. I feel so alone in this."
2061,depression,I ate chocolate and I actually enjoyed it! I watched a true crime video for an hour and I thought it was interesting!,I haven‚Äôt been able to enjoy junk food or entertainment for so long because of my depression. I feel so proud of myself!
2062,depression,What am I?,[removed]
2063,depression,I can't see any other way out,"I am so trapped. I constantly feel like I'll be the one who takes my life in my family.  Today I wrote: 

 

'Unsure of whether I should fear

That I see no other exit. 

All worn out and broken down.

A soul that is decrepit. 

I don't see peace or longevity that'll end in my omission

for when my journey ceases - it'll be of my volition'"
2064,depression,Depression changed my voice completely.,"My voice got so much deeper, more monotone than ever, quieter and it cracks nonstop lol it doesn't matter if I cry.

Now I always try to speak in a higher tone with my family and add higher or lower intonations into my speech so I sound normal even tho I know I sound more fake than ever. Also, talking fast seems so damn impossible I give up"
2065,depression,Welp. I‚Äôm very tired.,It‚Äôs my 29th birthday. I‚Äôm profoundly disappointed that there are theoretically so many more birthdays in my future. I can‚Äôt fathom feeling like this for another 29 years.
2066,depression,i think my brother is why i developed depression,"ever since my brother and i grew up together, he‚Äôs bullied me relentlessly. one time i remember locking myself in the bathroom because i was afraid he‚Äôd hurt me. i was 12 and he was 16. he banged on the door and called me a bitch because i wouldn‚Äôt give something to him. it‚Äôs always been like that. he would grab things out of my hands and basically get me to do whatever he wanted because he‚Äôs a lazy piece of shit. now whenever i bring up the way he treated me when we were younger, he apparently remembers none of it. i think he resents me because he was abused by our father and our dad treated me the total opposite. i was too scared to practice my native language because he would laugh at my accent and poor grammar. so for years, i never practiced. i fucking hate him. i tried for years to get him to like me and he can‚Äôt even remember the countless times he‚Äôs made me feel helpless and scared. i fucking hate him. now he‚Äôs matured but i fucking hate him."
2067,depression,Skipping therapy,I‚Äôve missed therapy for the past month and a half and I‚Äôve had a mental breakdown about twice every week. I always tell myself I don‚Äôt need it but then that shit happens and I fucken hate myself. I‚Äôll be popping Tylenol or some shit then be like ‚Äúwhat would happen if I took this whole ass bottle right now?‚Äù I‚Äôve been through bad shit in life and then question even needing therapy. But fuck it right. Hate this feeling.

2070,depression,I don‚Äôt know how to work anymore,"I‚Äôve been in a depressive episode for a couple of days now and haven‚Äôt gotten any work done. I‚Äôve been able to make up excuses but I can‚Äôt keep doing that. I don‚Äôt understand how people keep their jobs during this. I‚Äôve always just quit when it happens and found something new or taken a week off with some excuse, but that was service industry. Now I‚Äôm working a remote office job and don‚Äôt know what to do 
I just don‚Äôt have the motivation to do it and I can‚Äôt believe it may be this way forever. It‚Äôs terrifying"
2071,depression,Switching Therapist?,[deleted]
2072,depression,Slipping more and more...,"A year ago (pre-Covid), I was nearing 5 years sober, was the CTO of a great company, met my now fiance, hit the gym 4-5 times a week. Life was pretty good. So, Covid hit, our business closed, I had to go on unemployment, started drinking and doing other things, stopped working out and needless to say, made my life a mess. I'm supposed to get married next month and I just can't seem to get my shit together again. I'm disgusted with myself and lately, all I do is sleep. I go on these binges and that basically takes 2-3 days to recover just from that. 

I've alienated myself from all my friends, don't have family to talk to except a surviving sister who is also a shit show right now. I just can't seem to snap out of this and it's been a year!! Can anyone relate? Am I crazy?"
2073,depression,I feel so burned out and depressed,"It‚Äôs getting harder and harder to get up in the mornings. Since the 14. November everything besides groceries and going to work closed in my country. I just can‚Äôt deal with it anymore.

I barely have any social contacts, I live alone and family wise I ‚Äûonly‚Äú have my dad left. I try to have walks and to do online dating - but it just doesn‚Äôt give me anything back at this point anymore. Also I am an average guy, and dating is not working that good for me (I get on dating apps maximum 1 match a month. It is something that gives me hope on the one side, but is also brutal on the other side). 

Lastley my few close friends are either very wealthy and don‚Äòt mind the lockdown at all, or they are very deep into addiction. It‚Äòs also hard to connect with both of them since about Christmas. They don‚Äôt understand or are mad about me. And i don‚Äôt want to call them every third day because I feel like crying. I feel very ashamed.

Like the title says, I feel very depressed and want to cry and sleep until forever."

2075,depression,what do you guys eat when you are too depressed to cook?,"Whenever I‚Äôm feeling particularly depressed (which is often) I have a hard time eating because I lack the energy to make anything. And I know some of you can relate to this struggle! So I am looking for the most simple, low-effort meals that aren‚Äôt terrible for my health. What do you guys make? I can‚Äôt live on pb&amp;j and frozen chicken nuggets forever..."
2076,depression,Lack of dating life,[deleted]
2077,depression,I'm not alive for my own sake,"The only reason I'm still here is for the sake of my friend and family. Most of them doesn't deserve the trauma that comes when someone close to you dies suddenly. I both love them and hate them for that. If I got to choose without any regards as to anybody else's feelings, I probably wouldn't be here, but unfortunately I too have feelings. I've seen and experienced myself how it feels when somebody you care about die, and I can't possibly bring myself to be the cause of such suffering, no matter how much I suffer in the process of being alive. I really wish I didn't have to, but here we are."
2078,depression,Is anyone else feeling disconnected?,[removed]
2079,depression,"I really just need to talk, need support and encouragement.","A few years ago life took a sudden and shocking detour into mental illness, without prior history. Life and myself both unraveled. Today medication is finally working and I'm healing. But looking around at the tatters of myself and my life is becoming really overwhelming. Will anyone talk with me about this?

In hindsight, when the fog of illness appeared a few years ago it blinded me to myself and my words and actions. I can see so many horrible blind spots now. I've hurt people while I've been hurting, I've made *epicly* stupid mistakes, and I've been thoroughly self-absorbed. I lost a lot of friends. At the time I felt abandoned, and I was, but now looking back I'm ashamed to say that I deserved it.

This is keeping me up at night. There's so much, it's like flood gates were opened. I've done my best to face it all, sort it out, be kind to myself, forgive myself, and not shove it back down. It's a lot though. I hoped that I'd start to feel better, but it isn't getting easier. I'm exhausted.

I'm not ""hanging on"" to anything, or dwelling, or torturing myself. ""Just let it go"" is exactly what I want to do. It's a monster of anxiety and shame and regret that won't leave me alone. I'm so overwhelmed. I just want to feel better."

Can't cry at end..."
2081,depression,I don‚Äôt deserve you,"You have been very nice to me. I got mad at you for no reason again. You had a bad day and you still calm me down and not get mad at me. My wordings and tone wasn‚Äôt nice. You were still nice to me. I don‚Äôt deserve someone so nice in my life. 

You love me unconditionally. I am a mess. My emotions are fragile. I get sad. You were there for me and still talk to me. You still remind me how much you love me. I don‚Äôt deserve your love. 

I am a terrible person. I overdramatise everything. There was no break to my constant ‚Äúbad mood‚Äù. There wasn‚Äôt a day where I‚Äôm not mad or upset or depressed about something. And you are still here. I don‚Äôt deserve you."
2082,depression,Fun activities to do with an online depressed friend?,"I'm not personally depressed but I have a friend who means the absolute world to me. I've known her for about 3 months and she doesn't know reddit is a thing so I'm not really worried about her finding me here. With my IRL depressed buddies pre-quarantine I'd always try to include them in my plans just to show how much they mean to me, but I found reaching out to depressed friends can be waaaaay harder which sucks. 

Currently all we do is Netflix party mostly because none of us are really big on multiplayer games. We sometimes make each other playlists but I was wondering if someone can list some stuff they can do with their online friends. You don't have to be depressed to help me out.

The one thing I try to avoid is forcing her out of her comfort zone. I make preemptive plans with her and depending on her mood from texting her I try to gauge whether or not she really wants to do it. I don't want to force her to go through with it just because she made the plan with me and we get along quite well so its no big deal to turn down the plan for either of us. The problem is that we're also kinda running out of shows we both like and watching shows too often can suck. It doesn't help that I got ADHD so I end up usually getting off topic and losing track of the show which can be understandably frustrating for her, although surprisingly she hasn't lashed out on me. It might be that she's a really patient and amazing person. 

But yeah. 

love you all &lt;33333."

2085,depression,I don't have any normal hobbies and it makes it difficult to connect to normal people,It seems like everything I enjoy is strange. Stuff that very few people understand or get. The pandemic has made this worse due to my isolation. I feel like I don't have any normal hobbies so I find it difficult to connect to normal people.
2086,depression,Does anyone else feel like they wasted their potential?,"I have always felt I could have done so much more in life just with everything, I could have had a relationship maybe, I could be much further along in my career, have more of a life, etc. Too bad my anxiety messed up most of life and now I'm here, I'm not super sad about it I guess, just disappointed, especially when I go over imaginations in my head."
2087,depression,Working my a** off and it‚Äôs still not enough,[deleted]
2088,depression,living is too much work,"I wake up with physical pain in my chest every day that I have to get out of bed to go to the job I hold high contempt and dread for. I keep looking back to the past in hopes that maybe it'll come back; not because it was actually great, but because it was much better than the present before me. Every little difference in someone's tone or actions towards me is enough to send me spiraling for days, if not weeks. I want to just drop everything and take off somewhere but I lack the money, resources, and the courage to do so. If I were normal, I keep telling myself, then I wouldn't have these problems. I wouldn't hate my family, I wouldn't worry if my friends hate me. I wouldn't be weighing the little options I have: kill myself or run away and start over. I'm tired of being like this with no change. I'm tired of redundant days where I persuade myself to get up and be alright as if obligatory self-hype was any better than being unable to look in the mirror most days without a lump in my throat. I want things to change but I am afraid they will never get better. I want to change, but I am afraid it will always be this way."
2089,depression,Feeling inadequate and fed up,"To wrap the whole story in a ball..my high school sweetheart (of 13 years now) has decided he MAY want to be female, also may not. He has a severe addiction to trans porn (but he literally just watches it like it's tv and then will sleep or do something else). 

I'm knee deep in nursing school, have my entire family constantly saying it's stupid, or they make snarky comments about how long it's taking me. I pay all out of pocket, and have two small kids, so I only take as many classes as I can afford that semester. 

I feel inadequate and horrible about myself, due to the school comments and my husband's preference for trans girls on his phone over me. I have always battled badly with depression, I can literally sleep non stop for weeks if you let me. 

But, now, I feel like I have hit my wall. I have no motivation for anything, want to drop out of school..I would absolutely never do it, but I keep thinking about just hooking up with someone else, so I can feel good and feel adequate again. Especially since my husband is constantly asking if he can go drop a few hundred dollars to go meet up with a trans girl... Just been a shitty year and I'm mentally over it all."
2090,depression,Relapse,"It feels so defeating when you start to feel better and then fall back into your old habits, emotions, and self destruction. It‚Äôs kind of like a trick. My biggest fear is being as sick as I was 6 months ago or when I was 17 etc. Each time my depression reaches a new high point, I fear I‚Äôve done nothing right to combat it. All of my efforts are washed away. I always thought I didn‚Äôt have to think my adult life through because I wouldn‚Äôt be alive. Even though I‚Äôm committed to being alive now, how many times have I told myself that before?"

2100,depression,"Depressed girlfriend wants to break up with me. Is it possible that after recovering, she could still feel love for me?",
2101,depression,How do I escape this darkness I'm in?,"My life is technically one of the easiest. I don't have a wife or kids, great family and friends, I love the company I work for, make good enough money, and am in a living situation where I pay very very little rent.

However, I'm writing this from one of the darkest moments in my life. While I love my company, I can't stand my boss. I am extremely over worked (working very long hours and weekends) and never have time to prioritize certain passions outside of work. I feel like I'm behind in the latest technology stacks and would like to learn them, but honestly, every time I'm done with work, the last thing I want to do is be on a computer. I feel stuck in my position because I feel no team or company wants what skills I can bring. I'm an extremely hard worker, always delivering on time with quality, and my coworkers say I'm talented, but my boss doesn't appreciate me.

On top of that, my love life is non-existent. The last girl I liked left me for someone who lives across the country and I can't get over it. I rarely get matches in online dating, but when I do, they say 1 thing (if I'm lucky) and never talk to me again. I've lost all confidence in my physical appearance and hate the many things that are ugly about me. Friends and family say I'm ""a catch"" but no one seems to notice.

But like I said, my life is easy. I am blessed that I technically have the freedom I have. But I also hate my life currently. I'm not suicidal, but I do wish I was dead. I'd like to seek help, but I don't think a therapist will work. I just feel stuck and alone in a life that keeps dragging on. I honestly don't know how people with kids and other stresses keep going. You are all amazing and I feel like an asshole for complaining when I think about you. But this is my life.

If anyone has any ideas to help please let me know."
2102,depression,Scared of getting better,I had a psychiatric appointment earlier. I had been putting it off for months but had a moment of motivation last week and booked a meeting. The moment was short lived but I thought I may aswell go anyway. They prescribed me with Sertraline and I'm gonna be on it next week. The reason I'm scared is because knowing I can kill myself at any moment brought a level of comfort in my life for the last 10 months. It helps me have the mindset of well I can always do it tomorrow. I know I can't be happy in my current circumstances and it's why I want to end it all. But I still have that small feeling of wanting to get better because I know how good life can be. I'm scared if I start taking these meds that I will be in a middle state of not being happy but not sad enough to die. I'm scared of being in the middle just suffering
2103,depression,Giving up on your passion,"I sit here with a bullshit degree in History despite my love for it. There was no reason for it. There's no way you can leverage what I have into something without it having an Ivy league status on it.

2104,depression,There isn‚Äôt a way to get help.,"I‚Äôve been massively depressed for 3 years now, been on and off suicide watch for 2 years and I‚Äôm convinced there is no way to get help. Full disclosure I‚Äôve got BPD as well and surprise surprise my ex left me due to a mix of BPD and depression. I live in UK where healthcare is free and yet I‚Äôve been through all channels and I still just slip the wide fucking cracks.

It‚Äôs been 2 years since my ex left me and I‚Äôve ruined my fucking life, even before it, FOR HER as well. I just don‚Äôt see any end to my torment. I don‚Äôt get how it gets better. I want to just be free of this pain. Tonight I took 4x the max dose of my strong fucking meds and I just feeling like tomorrow I‚Äôm going to take 30+ plus just for the slightest bit of fucking attention. I‚Äôve even written a one sentence note for my ex just in case.

I‚Äôm starting to feel the meds I took now and I just want to say that everything is fucked. It‚Äôs all fucking fucked. Society doesn‚Äôt give a shit if you‚Äôve got any issue, you‚Äôre just another cog in the machine. Fuck you,"
2105,depression,Goodbye,[deleted]
2106,depression,Plateauing (Bipolar Depression),"I'm a 20 year old guy. These are the years I should be having the time of my life right? At least thats what society pushed on me as a kid. Now, I'm just having a hard time understanding. As days pass I find myself consistently doing the same things over and over. I try to branch out and do activities I haven't done or done in a while, but I never seem to enjoy them. I understand that I'm not going to enjoy everything, but can't I at least enjoy something? Video games, music, movies, being with friends, dating, everything just seems so bland and uninteresting, or a waste of my time (like I'm not wasting my time laying in bed for 70% of my day). It hurts my heart that I haven't felt happy since, well I'm not even sure when. The closest I get to feeling excited about something is when I get addicted to it for the first week or two I start. Then I just lose interest. If I can't be happy I'd at least like to make something of myself, hopefully that will give me the motivation I need. Whenever I try to learn something new I get too ahead of myself in my mind and I end up expecting expert level results quickly. This results in me losing interest because I believe I can not achieve whatever goal or expectation I set for myself. At this point I've realized I am my own worst enemy. I don't know what happened to the person I used to be. I miss him. Weed is the only way I feel like me again. I used to be so full of energy and excitable. Sometimes I can get frenzied abnormal excitement bursts. Other times I feel like a magnet to my bed, sinking in my sheets just to escape from everything. When I don't have these emotional issues I am just neutral. Numb. Because of this, it discourages me and I am scared of social interactions. I'm scared to and get a job. Its getting to the point where I'm running out of my savings but I can't emotionally and physically get myself to go out there and just live life. It's gotten even worse since the pandemic. Staying in my bedroom all day because I feel safest. Even though it's probably killing me. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. Death to me is just an easy way out. As much as I want to be happy someday. I don't want to hurt anymore. I am so fucking sad. I've been putting this off for a while because I don't know who to talk to. I feel like everyone looks down on me, and if I share the deepest part of me. The part I never share with anyone, how I feel, I start to think they'll see me as some dopey loser. I hope someone can read this and understand that you're not alone. I also hope I can get help from another source thats not a doctor, I hate the way my anti-depressants make me feel. I'm starting two college classes soon, I hope I can manage."
2107,depression,I'm disappointed with the way I was raised,"My parents are not very smart and did not do a good enough job preparing me for adulthood. They made a lot of poor choices in their lifetimes and they've taken to blaming me for some of them.

They believe it is my responsibility to settle their concerns and they place their happiness on my shoulders.

I was not raised as I should have been.My childhood was spent indoors as I was not allowed outside and I was discouraged from having friends. As a result I was socially stunted. I grew up in a poor neighborhood with low class people. I had no opportunity to socialize with anyone.

I felt disempowered and isolated. I did poorly in high school because I felt left out of social life and I lacked crucial skills in interpersonal relationships and self regulation in public. I'm very ashamed of the things I did between the ages of 12 and 18, some of which were crimes and morally reprehensible.

I performed below expectations in high school and went to University completely unprepared for higher education and for life. I did not even understand what a bachelor's degree was, I was just following a path expected of me by my parents. I wasted 4 years in University and another 4 afterwards struggling with my mental state and struggling to find a job. I struggled to go back to school because of my poor grades, low confidence, and bad associations with formal education.

I feel that I was unprepared for life due to poor parenting, bullying, low quality education, bad choices and my own stupidity, immaturity and intrinsic, innate worthlessness.

I am 26 years old without a worthwhile education, gainful career path, healthy social circle, life experience or healthy state of mind. I am lacking in every conceivable area of my life and I have had little to no real successes of significance in the past 8 years of my existence. I am no better today than I was on my 18th birthday.

In comparison, others in my demographic have built financial nest eggs for themselves, forged strong relationships, carved out careers, traveled the world extensively and meticulously documented their travels, improved their skillsets and planned for their futures.

I, on the other hand, have humiliated myself publicly, failed in school, boast and empty resume, been housebound for nearly 3 decades, inching closer to being on the wrong side of 30 with nothing to show for it but an overweight and aging body and a laundry list of failures and bad decisions.

No one can say with any conceivable stretch of the imagination that I am not a failure of a man. I have failed to launch and failed to make any use of the opportunities I had. Anyone with half a brain and an ounce of common sense would have done better than me.

I feel that I have missed the boat to justify my existence and that I have failed too severely to find any real purpose or desire to live. Anything I do will be clouded with the poison of my past. I cannot enjoy living because I have never enjoyed living. I have had a bad life that didn't need to be so, had those around me, and I myself included, been better suited for the roles we found ourselves in and better prepared for adulthood and responsibility.

I should have been taught financial literacy, how to talk to people, shown my options instead of being herded in my caregivers' self interests. I should have been raised by people who understood what they were advising me about, people with critical thinking skills who could guide me with kindness and wisdom rather than fear and insecurity

I wish I were someone better, someone normal. I wish I'd had a more normal life and not this. My problems are stupid and I am stupid. What kind of low worth dumb loser wastes everything he had to end up like this. Nearly 30, living with his mother, no romantic or social experience at all, no job, poor grades, disconnected from anything and everything, not in control of his own life.

I have written a lot because I do not speak to anyone about this. I hardly open my mouth at all. I was a mistake and I shouldn't have been born"

2110,depression,I think I need help,"I don't want to make a long post but if I have to I will. I'm in my second year of college and I'm lost in life. In the summer of 2019, I found out I have mono and during the same time my father attempted to kill himself. Even before then, I couldn't get these thoughts of my family dying out of my head and it would keep me up at night. Between then and now I had one major breakdown where I just completely gave up on classes for a week. January so far, has been a terrible month for me. I just can't stop thinking about the future and I feel like such a failure to everyone. I got a job for myself because people expected me to and my girlfriend also wanted e to. I'm not sure if I can handle a job while also doing school full time. I'm also not sure if my career means anything anymore. I'm an English major because writing was the only thing I could actually do and enjoy but everyone I talk to basically sees it as a waste of money and maybe it is. I'm scared because sometimes I just think of ending it all because I don't want to see anyone else around me die, but I'm also tired of everyone being disappointed in me. I'm not sure what to do anymore and I don't have anyone to go to."

Okay. My name (or online alias) is Rue. So, all of the events that I'm about to tell you about happened from ages 4-10. I don't remember when each thing happened so I do apologize for that.

When I was younger I had this group of friends. They're all much older than me. Each of em' being 5 or 6 years older than me so as of now they're all 19 or 20. I'm going to be calling them BAS. I would use their names but I won't out of fear someone I know may see this and do something to them. And before i get into the story, yes, they're all girls.

So, BAS. They were really my only friends throughout my childhood, I was bullied a lot in elementary school and Im the youngest of 5 so my siblings never really hung out with me much. BAS were my friends. I like to think so anyways. At first they did abandon me quite a bit. They would make me stay at the top of the street while they all went off and hung out. I remember sitting at the top of the street on my bike with our home phone waiting for them to tell me when to come down. They never did until they came back up and went home.

Let it be know that I do still deeply care for and love each one of these girls. I know I probably shouldn't, but they were still there for me when no one else was, even if they were still horrible to me. They helped me survive my childhood while also making it worse for me in the future. I have mixed feelings about it all if you can't tell.

My home life wasn't the best (I don't feel like getting into it too much so just trust me or look at some of my other posts if you'd like) and so I was more often than not hanging out with BAS. 

So. Here goes everything. The part I've been locking up in my mind for so very long. It's been slowly draining me and eating away at the little will to live I have left.

They rape me.

It all starts with a blanket fort and some good old fashioned truth or dare. 

Harmless? Right..

Well, no. I'm gonna tell you what I remember, and I'm not sure that I remember it all but I'm honestly sorry if you have read this far and are going to continue on because it gets bad for little 4-10 year old Rue from here on out.

The first thing about truth or dare I remember was the rules. After 2 truths you HAD to pick a dare or else you had to do the punishment (it was probably something stupid like lick a toilet seat or something I dunno) and so I always followed their rules. Keep in mind I also wanted to impress them cause they were older and cool and I wanted to be accepted as their friend. I remember this dare. ""I dare you to eat me out."" Now at the time I had no clue what that was so they showed me by eating me out and then had me do the same. I ate the one who dared me out, A. I dont remember a lot from it..thinking about it makes me kinda sick cause I viewed them as my sisters. And this one happened in our little blanket fort. Parts of me will probably never trust blanket forts again heh..

The next thing I remember was the group masturbation. It was probably also cause of a dare but I dont remember. I remember them taking me to the bathroom with them (none of this takes place at my house or when any adult is anywhere around) and them taking their pants and underwear off, telling me to do the same. I did as I was told. I remember not knowing what was happening and then them shoving a uh, a plunger inside me (hurt a lot) and kind of, uhm, ig, raping me with it...then they told me to keep doing it to myself and I did as I was told even though it hurt. They were masturbating and moaning. They never turned the lights on. I can't imagine seeing their faces after they did something like that to me..

The third thing I remember. I dont remember very much from this. But A had a dog and BAS kept daring me to suck his dick. I don't recall ever doing it but I remember how much pressure they put on me to do it..

And the final thing I remember....
Probably one of the hardest things to remember..

BAS tried to get me to suck my brothers dick. 
My brother was also friends with BAS (he had/has no idea what BAS did to me) and they were playing truth or dare. My brother didn't know I was there. They blindfolded him and put earmuffs on his head so he had no idea what was happening. He unzipped his pants and they pulled out his dick..horrifying...then they started forcing my head down, trying to make me give my own brother a blow job....I broke free and ran away, I ran to the park and just cried for a while. My brother still has no idea that this happened to me and I have no idea what happened after I left...

BAS did a lot to me...but they were intertwined with my entire family. Everyone in my family knew/knows them and all still love them dearly. I'm unsure of how to proceed with all of this constantly bouncing around in my head..it's hard to handle. Some people say I should press charges but I know it'd be too late. I love BAS anyways and dont know if I could ever face them while bringing this up.

If anyone has any advice on how to live with myself and get over this all then that would be very much appreciated. I apologize for this post being so long but thank you for reading all the way to the end &lt;3 
Here's a poem I wrote for your troubles

Gone:

Gone with the wind

But a humble speck of dust

Viewing the world through my various endeavors 

The wind carries me 

I go where it pleases

The winds cradle me as I whisper in your ears

I'm invisible

I'm gone with the wind before you can see me pass by

A humble speck of dust

Watching this world

Watching the chaos

Watching you

Watching me

Watching us

Just a humble speck of dust

Gone with the wind"
2112,depression,i want to love life but i don‚Äôt know how to,"i‚Äôm only 17. i have a whole life ahead of myself yet my life has gone to shit in so many ways. my parents aren‚Äôt together but both of them are emotionally unstable and a lot of my childhood was dealing with the trauma that my mother gave me because of her untreated bipolar disorder. this past summer my best friend‚Äôs boyfriend killed himself and she stopped talking to me because she told me that i was somehow responsible for his death. i can‚Äôt help but constantly think about all of the pain i put onto her already difficult life because i tried to introduce her to a boy i hardly knew the winter before. i hate myself so much; everything i do seems to be a constant reminder of the pain. when i have trouble zipping up my pants that are 4 sizes bigger than they were a year ago, i feel so disgusting because i know i‚Äôm thirty pounds heavier from the binge eating. i met with a nutritionist to kick the habit but i‚Äôve just gotten heavier. when i have pictures taken of me by my boyfriend or friends, i immediately want them to be deleted because i can see how fat i am and how disgusting i look now compared to less than a year ago. i don‚Äôt even look like myself anymore and i can barely take care of myself and my body. i constantly feel like i don‚Äôt deserve it and i should just die for the sake of everyone around me and their wellbeing. i hate that i can‚Äôt fit into any of my clothes that i used to fit in consistently for the past four years. i can‚Äôt lose the weight and it‚Äôs making me so miserable. i feel so ugly. i‚Äôve thought about breaking up with my boyfriend of over a year so many times because i just can‚Äôt make him happy and i‚Äôm constantly crying, complaining, angry, or having a panic attack. when my boyfriend and our mutual best friend tell me how beautiful they think i am, i can‚Äôt help but want to cry because i don‚Äôt believe them at all and i can‚Äôt fathom that someone could think that about me, after all of this trauma and grief and depression and insanity that has plagued me and only built up for the last seventeen years of my life. i want to let go but their eyes that always smile at me tell me i can‚Äôt, because i know that there are happy times with them. i like feeling the rays of happiness try to permeate the cloud of darkness over my head, even if only for a split second, through my laughter or my smile that i can feel stretch across my face. deep down i know life is worth living but i can‚Äôt help but contemplate suicide and stay up late calculating the lethal amounts of drugs for my height and weight. i feel the constant urge to self harm because it‚Äôs been a habit that i can‚Äôt get rid of even after all these years. i have nasty marks all over my left thigh and my forearm and i feel the cringing looks from others when my sleeve accidentally comes up too high on my arm. i just don‚Äôt know how much longer i can keep pretending like i‚Äôm okay. i‚Äôm burning out so quickly; i feel like a lit candle with the lid on, where the flame is so vibrant for a time until suddenly it just extinguishes at once from the oxygen shortage. i feel like i can‚Äôt breathe"
2113,depression,What's wrong with me,"Like I've wanted to find out what's wrong with me most of my life. I feel so horrible and recently I have been wishing I were dead(but then when I think about death too much my anxiety kicks in). I'm married and have a dog. But it's so hard to take the dog outside, but I do it anyway. I try my best to be around my husband but I feel like I'm not really there. Me being able to do those things makes me think that I'm just taking or being lazy. At least that's something I know my family will say if I tell them how I'm feeling. Oh and sometimes my mood changes so drastically. I'll be really happy for a day or two and then my depression slams me back down. 
When I'm depressed it gets really bad for me. Like I can't even look at myself in the mirror or look people in the eye. I just feel ugly and hate myself."
2114,depression,Looking for help,"Hi, so I just installed reddit on my phone and I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing right now and I‚Äôm feeling stupid by even writing this. I created my account about a year ago, som I‚Äôm not entirely new to this thing, but I still need to get used to this. It‚Äôs been a month or so that I started reading reddit posts about how fucked up people‚Äôs lives are and how some people just wanna fucking die. I‚Äôm at the lowest point of my life right now: emotional and economical. For example I really love gaming, but I‚Äôm too poor to buy a good setting and play good games. On the emotional side, I have no one to talk to and all families and friends around me just make the situation worse. Even my parents crush my soul. I don‚Äôt know. I just wanted to embrace this thing. I appreciate every comment.
Ps: I really don‚Äôt know how reddit works so sorry."

2116,depression,I'm glad these communities exist,"It doesn't feel right to post this on r/suicidewatch, though that is the sub this post is about. Unsure what to title this as well. 

Couple years (and accounts) ago I made a post there about my imminent death, planning on jumping after finishing my drink. It just seemed like my existence was burdensome, to the point I'd force myself back asleep because it made me feel like I simply wasn't.

I posted on suicidewatch for the only time that night, and received many ""hey life is worth living, want to talk"" messages, which came from a nice place, but the very last thing I wanted to do was explain myself, it felt incredibly narcissistic, manipulative, and self indulgent to talk about myself since I felt all I did was think about how I felt, and it sickened me. I also didn't want to feel that other person's pressure for me to live.

So I wasn't sure what I was looking for in making that post, and don't want to reveal too much so others can't find my old accounts (im sure I've said things I'm ashamed of) but after an hour there was a comment or two (may have combined them in my mind) which helped me. 

It went something like, ""what you said about how every moment of happiness feels selfish cleared some shit up for me, thanks. Everyone has a time to clock out, if yours is now then enjoy the fall.""


Something in my whiskey soaked brain seemed to click, and I let myself pass out that night. I wasn't delighted to be alive the next morning, things didn't radically change, but the idea that someone heard what I was dealing with and replied so nonchalantly made me smile, the fact that it helped them understand themselves a bit better was just gravy.

A bit later on I stood on the edge of a high rise's roof and stared straight down, forced myself to make the decision right then, forever. If I hadn't had that previous experience, I'm not sure that would have gone the way it did.


Today, I wouldn't call myself exactly ""cured"", but life is pretty fucking great compared. Even the in-between moments that would ruin the day have become easier to deal with. I'm basically only doing things that I enjoy or that bring me closer to my goals, whereas before I'd punish myself with tasks and not pay attention to my body. Only downside is that I waste time on dating apps since my sex drive is back and way up, but I'm a bit lazy with it and am waiting for a girl to trip into my lap.

This post is rather lengthy, sorry, but I suppose it's right to thank those who take the time to connect with the stranger having an awful day, and especially to those who understand that while suicide isn't a solution, it is an option, and that simply denying that reality to suicidal people only makes em feel more alienated."
2117,depression,I've never felt more lonely than when my friends and family say they care,"My parents were on the cusp of a divorce by the time I was born. They fought like hell for years over me and my siblings. Put us in the middle of their conflict. Both convinced they were right, that they loved us more than the other parent, etc. They did and I believe do both love us in their way as best they can, but they're products of their own bullshit.

My mom used to hold me when I was angry or sad or screaming, often to see my dad or to stop fighting or whatever, and she would just tell me I couldn't see him or that he needed to change or whatever. It was a regular occurrence for me to erupt emotionally and for her to comfort me in this way. On some physical level it was absolutely comforting, I would exhaust myself in her arms and warmth and finally fall asleep. This is clearest example I've found, but similar patterns repeated with both parents for years. The psychological torture in tandem with the physical comfort really fucked me up. Like, 30 years later and I feel like I'm just starting to see how fucked up it is.

I knew there were problems, I've been to therapy, I've managed to build relationships of all types, some seemingly quite strong. I make them love me, like lay down in the road obsessive love. It's not a healthy love, and once I feel like it's there I spin them through my mental labyrinths, repeating the trauma I went through, knowing they can't pull away from that love addiction. There is always a distance, or a conflict, or a tension with them. I equate any hint of their love/care/compassion with that mental anguish. I run from it or reject it or don't believe it or find it hollow or temper my experience of it waiting for the floor to drop, denying their gift to me. And it always does at some point. Every significant relationship I've built mirrors that opposition in some way. I'm uninterested without the drama, the pain, and conflict, the empty words and touches coupled with sadistic actions and behaviors. I'm always on the cusp of misery, with spurts of emotional highs just enough to keep me clinging to some hope of some feeling of security that will come just on the other side of...

The more I understand about the pattern, the more I try to rise above it. To call it out with partners or friends. To break the fourth wall, use safe words, attempt to navigate the chaos in tandem. But it doesn't seem to lessen. It's made things stable enough to carry on day to day for the most part, but the intensity of the fucking roller coaster, of the peaks and troughs, is getting brutal the older I get and the higher the stakes. It's like an addiction, needing a higher dose of both love and pain each time I oscillate to pull back towards a center.

My family won't give up on me but they don't want to actually understand what's in my head (I've tried so many fucking times) because it causes them discomfort. They tell me to stop torturing myself, to stop dwelling on the past, to think positive. As if this is all just some game I'm playing because I'm bored or something. I don't know how to break the pattern because every time I make a deliberate attempt to it just somehow ends up playing right in to the cycle. I'm intractably lonely whether with someone or not and I don't know which is worse anymore.

Every time someone tells me they care (particularly fam) I either go ape shit and terrify them with the reality of my mind or pull as far away as possible without breaking the string between us for days, weeks, months until the cycle repeats. I'm fucking tired of the cycle. I just want peace."
2118,depression,"I don't know where to talk, I just want to write","(Sorry for my English, i try to do my best)

I don't know where to talk about this, but I just want to write, I feel so tired of everything, of the people, of the media, of my city, of thinking, of feelings, I think that the reasons of many people here are more serious than mine, and I honestly think that the reason why I write is stupid, but feeling like that just for a woman who left me 2 years ago, yeah it‚Äôs a stupid reason, or I don't know Maybe it‚Äôs not, i don't know. I don't want to do anything, study, work, meet people, look for opportunities, I just want to disappear to some place where she doesn‚Äôt look for me anymore, where she does not make me feel crazy, a place where she does not appear in dreams, a place where the songs don‚Äôt speak to me about her, just  I want some peace some tranquility, I don't want to think any more or doubt about that woman who tells me that she feels the same as me, that tells me that I am the love of her life ... I know that she is lying to me, although I want to believe that she is not. But well, I know I'm not good enough for her, that's what she makes me understand.

This feeling really tires, so much time, and so much loneliness, it doesn't bother me to be alone, I just would like to feel good somewhere, maybe find someone who makes me feel good, that although can't promise me that everything will be fine, but just tell me that I‚Äôm gonna be fine, I just wanna hear something, whatever."

2124,depression,"Minimalism, hoarding and depression","Hi everybody, I'm 27 years old, and I've been a sort of a hoarder for my first 20 years of my life. After lots of hard times, I decided to declutter my room, and my possessions in general. I purged tons of useless stuff, and then discovered minimalism. I kept reducing my possessions because it felt good, and the right thing to do. Owning less was great, and it brought me joy. But now, I'm suffering again from depression, I spend all my time in bed, sleeping or thinking, and this is happening: I miss all the things that I removed from my life, from sentimental items to... Well, anything. I'm really regretting getting rid of all that stuff, because I'm facing a period of deep nostalgia, and I just want to drown myself in memories, physical and non, but I'm left without most of the little gadgets, toys, old books, and so on, and I feel very bad about it. I really don't know how to cope with these feelings, these thoughts, because they're becoming kinda an obsession. I think I'm just gonna collecting stuff again, hoarding but more wisely, to suppress my emotions and trying to repair what I've done in these 7 years. Because I'm not designed to be happy, since my teen years I suffered from mental illnesses, and even if I'm seeing a couple of therapists (a psychologist and a psychiatrist, for my meds), things will never change. I'm going to live in my room (I'm an ex-hikikomori), accumulating treasures and burying my mind in deep sleep and stuff. Sorry for this rant, I already posted it on r/minimalism, but I thought that maybe here you can help me with some advice, somebody who faced the same problems as me could have a solution. Thank you!"

This year, I got into my dream school and program. But I couldn't do it online, so I withdrew. I hope to go back when possible but more and more that seems unlikely that'll happen anytime soon. Now it feels like I'm going nowhere. I'm 21 and all my peers are close to graduation and seem to have everything figured out. People keep telling me it'll work out but I don't believe them anymore.

I don't get any satisfaction from my hobbies anymore and feel tired all the time as well. Then I feel guilty about not doing anything and it just compounds the problem. Luckily, my family is supportive. But deep down I truly believe they're disappointed in me. I feel empty. Negative thoughts go through my head all day and I don't know how to stop them. I can't seem to distract myself from them. I feel as though if I try to reframe my thoughts positively, then I'm not holding myself accountable for what I percieve to be my failure as a person. There was a time when I believed in myself and had confidence. Now that feels long gone. And I don't know how to get back to that point."

I need something to hold onto. something about myself to love. someone who cares about me. a life worth living. I've been trying to give this to myself and I don't understand how its this much of a battle, It feels like I cant get that and its my fault. Its definitely me.

2130,depression,Roommates leave me out of everything,"Don‚Äôt really know why I am posting this, but I needed somewhere to vent. I have been ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù with one of my roommates for about 5-6 years. We met in high school and decided to be roommates our freshman year, but our sophomore year we moved off campus and had another roommate move in with us. We have a 3 bedroom townhouse and their bedrooms are upstairs next to each other and mine is located in the basement. I have always felt so excluded, even from the first year we all started living together, but this year is fucking horrible. In particular today they were talking about scheduling conflicts and 3 hour time difference blah blah and I decided to ask them if they were going to the west coast and my one roommate responds and says ‚ÄúYeah hahaha, we are going to Colorado, but like obviously with other people not just us two.‚Äù So, that was a great way to find out that I am going to be alone one week of the semester. They didn‚Äôt even have the decency to tell me prior. I have been dealing with the exclusion for so long and I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point.

Art is my life. Being a drag queen is my life, but due to priorities, I can no longer do either for the time being and I can feel any of good feelings I've had leftover, tricking away from me. I feel disposable to my drag family. I feel disposable to my biological family. I feel used on a daily basis and my brain keeps telling me that I'm only included in both families daily lives, because I was there in the beginning and they don't know how to get me to leave and I can't honestly tell if my brain is tricking me or warning me anymore.

But no the water went cold.

I'm sick, dealing with TBI/post concussive syndrome, and in so much fucking pain. I just wanted to soak, hope it cleared my sinuses, maybe it'll ease the neck and head pain for the hour I was in there. Nope.

Then I dropped my towel in the god damn water.

I feel like I can't have anything. All I wanted today was a god. damn. bath. That's it.

I can't function, literally. Everything I do is painful and exhausting. Thirty minutes of house work and I have to sleep because of migraines. That's on a good day. And now I'm sick with god knows what. I'm so stressed out and miserable.

""Self care is easy"" they said."
2147,depression,Needing help to determine an action plan," 

I am a good bullshitter. I don‚Äôt  think there has been a person alive who could bull shit you with the  confidence and finesse that I possess. Its a defense mechanism you see.  If I can convince you all that I am fine and that things are going  swimmingly, then I can in time come to believe it myself on some level.  Even though there is that nagging place in the corner hidden from view  that knows the truth. And that truth slowly seeps out and wishes to be  known, because maybe someone will see that I am no longer even treading  water, but have in fact taken on too much and am damn near sunk.

That  is where we are. For the past three or four years now, I have had worse  and worse health. Most of you who are close to me know what that is due  to. Its been nearly 10 years now since I had emergency Gall Bladder  removal surgery. For nearly seven months prior to the surgery I had a  weird feeling in my abdomen where I felt like I was a book and that was  my spine if that makes sense. This was coupled with chronic constipation  and abdominal pain that would come and go. But I was told I was crazy  and it was nothing. Until they finally took me seriously and my gall  bladder had become so infected and swollen that it didn‚Äôt have gall  stones anymore, but was filled with sludge.

So  I had that removed and nearly died. The surgery itself seemed to have  gone fine but in the recovery they noticed that I had rattling in my  lungs and my anesthesiologist said I am pretty certain he has developed  Pneumonia and looked at my x-rays and said that was the case. The Doctor  over recovery said I didn‚Äôt and he was being overly emotional. That  didn‚Äôt set well with my guy who went to bat for me. Turned out I did in  fact have a gnarly case of Pneumonia AND for a bonus, my Hemoglobin was  at 6 when it was supposed to be a 12 which indicated internal bleeding  some where. They could not tell me where. So I was admitted and spent  over a week in the hospital being pumped full of antibiotics and for the  first time in my life, blood infusions.

I  was sent home with no real support system or what to look for other  than ‚ÄúIf your incision opens go to ER‚Äù. Well that‚Äôs a given. So when  things hurt, I stopped doing them. Well this led to me slowly getting  weaker and weaker. On top of that I developed even more intense  depression. I began to cry out of no where, and I am not talking single  tears of reminiscing, but full on ‚ÄúMy dog just got hit by a car right in  front of me, and this dog is the dog that helped deliver me when my  mother died during child birth and in essence raised me‚Äù. That was new.  But so too was the isolation. It was slow at first. But little by little  I stopped going out with friends and my husband and instead opted to  stay at the house.

Well this  continued, the isolation got worse. My depression got worse. My muscles  atrophied, and issues related to my Rickets started to get worse. My  hearing started going out faster and faster to the point that if you  speak to me on my right side, don‚Äôt expect an answer. I have since been  to a boat load of doctors thanks to my PCP who took my concerns  seriously and always got me the referrals to the relevant people. I  started seeing an Endocrinologist for my X-linked Hypophosphatemic  Rickets (XLH) which is a rare genetic form of Rickets. I then started  seeing a rheumatologist for my persistent lower back pain. When I had  been in a car accident a few thanksgivings back, they had noticed on my  X-Rays that my discs in my back were fusing together. Well turns out  that they are! I also have Ankylosing Spondylitis which accounts for the  horrible back pain and tailbone pain as well as a few other things I  had been dealing with. AS is an autoimmune disease. It causes the body  to attack itself which causes inflammation which leads to the pain and  other things.

Well the above  things have crippled me in many ways. I can no longer walk. I can stand  for brief periods to transfer out of bed to my manual wheel chair or my  power chair and then to the car if I need to go to an appointment but  that is it. Because of my tailbone pain I can‚Äôt sit up for long so once  my appointments done, I have to get home and to bed. I cant even sit up  in bed, and have to have a bed that has the ability to lower and raise  the head and feet independently so throughout the day I can alleviate  the pressure on my tailbone and get even minor relief.

So  my days consist of being bed bound in my room where I never leave.  These four walls are my prison. My range of motion is gone. So I cant  bend over if I drop anything on the floor. Since my gall bladder removal  I developed a condition called Dumping Syndrome. This means I have  diarrhea everyday of my life. It will hit with literally zero warning,  and at the worst times. So in my mid to late 20‚Äôs I had to start wearing  Adult Diapers. In the beginning I could change them myself and clean  myself up if needed no problems. Now, due to my muscle atrophy and range  of motion going to shit, I can not. I now depend on my husband to clean  me up when I have Bowel Movements. I also can no longer Shower on my  own or fully dress myself without my husband. He works 70 hours a week.  So some days if I have a bowel movement I get to sit in it for 8-10  hours until he can come home. This has become problematic.

During  all of the things I have listed above I have been coming to terms with  the fact I am Trans. That will be a post for another time. But the  dysmorphia is severe now and has been an aggravating factor in my mental  health deterioration. I look in the mirror at my knotted and matted  hair and the beard I am now sporting, due to not having the ability or  the energy to shave any more, and I cry. My anxiety shoots through the  roof. I hate the person staring back at me. Who I see doesn‚Äôt match who I  see myself as if that makes sense. All the while I would love to be  living my fully authentic self, which my husband fully supports and has  been just the best about to be quite honest, but I don‚Äôt know where to  begin. Where do I get a custom wig made for myself that looks natural. I  fear being clocked in public. How do I address the facial hair and arm  hair so I again can look how I feel. Makeup, I don‚Äôt have the faintest  Idea of how to put it on, if I even have the limb dexterity to do that  now. I am overwhelmed.

I find  myself thinking about my death a great deal lately. Obsessively. I am  afraid of dying. But I feel like I will be dead soon as my health and  overall state of being has gotten so bad. I can‚Äôt roll over in my own  bed. I get winded adjusting in the bed. I am a burden to the man who I  vowed to be a helpmate to. I need help. I want help but god knows where  the hell to get it. I have been researching Inpatient facilities I could  go to get some intensive therapy and help but they are all so far away,  or expensive as hell. And trying to find one that will help me with the  transgender issues I face and won‚Äôt try and change me or will be safe  for me to be in (patients wise) is overwhelming and scary and so far,  fruitless.

I don‚Äôt know where to  go or what to do. I do know this will be where I put my thoughts about  things. Maybe you are in a similar boat and we can talk and support one  another, or maybe you just would like to follow me on this journey of  life. I welcome you regardless so long as your intentions are pure.  Anyone wishing to make cruel jokes or whatever, please don‚Äôt waste  either of our times. Positivity only.

‚Äî‚Äî-

That‚Äôs  from my blog so I don‚Äôt have to rehash everything. At this point I‚Äôm  not sure what to do. I know I need inpatient help. Outpatient isn‚Äôt well  suited for me as i require ridged structure and medicine tweaks as  everything I‚Äôve taken since I was 7 for my depression has failed. I‚Äôm 31  now. I‚Äôm at the end of my rope. I was in kosairs Children‚Äôs hospital  when I was 14 for 3 months after a suicide attempt. It helped some but  at 14 I wasn‚Äôt taking it nearly as seriously as I should have. But the  structure helped, but once I was back with my family they didn‚Äôt help me  hold myself accountable and stick with things and they were hella  abusive and toxic. I am married now and my husband is the best there is  and super supportive of me always so I know once I find a place that  will work with my unique set of circumstances and I can get the tools to  begin to take back my life he will be Cagney to my Lacey and make sure I  stick with it. Any advice or places you could recommend for a trans  individual with multiple mental and physical health issues and that  works with low income people. I have found a ton of outpatient places  that are waaaaaaay too expensive and I just have Blue cross and blue  shield and my premiums and everything just reset T.T"
2148,depression,The highs and lows of coffee/caffeine are preferable to the numbness of depression,"At first, I didn't like coffee very much, on the basis I'd get terrible caffeine-crashes that killed my mood, and I sometimes get bad intrusive thoughts on the ""comedown"" in addition to my usual intrusive thoughts.

I feel like no one really even wants me around and I'm just a nuisance and nobody will ever love me and I'll die alone. It feels even harder for me because I dont want children in the future and everyone else does. I almost thought I couldve started dating a friend until I found out from someone else that he was still hung up about his ex. I felt so frustrated and depressed over this I don't know what to do.

2167,depression,Post title (required),"I‚Äôve had many stages in my life so far with various states to define them. Stages of sadness, stages of anger, stages of love, stages of hope and stages of hopelessness. The most painful period was my stage of nothing.

My stage of nothing is quite simple; I felt nothing, and it was excruciating. I used to think that feeling nothing would be better than feeling sad, but I was misled. Things nosedived with the terrifying moment of looking into the mirror and seeing something I couldn‚Äôt recognize, staring back into my eyes with a cold, dead stare. 

That day I started drafting my four suicide notes (one of sorries and reason, one of thank yous, one of ramblings and one of self-anger) and preparing myself for the deed. I was already used to getting a high feeling from self strangulation, so it wasn‚Äôt a huge task. I even laid out a method and symbolism in it.

I am still here because someone came into my life, or maybe I came into theirs, je ne sais pas. Both of us had our baggage. I felt crippling nothingness and she felt the effects of abuse at the hands of others.

We had known about each other for years, but never became even as much as acquaintances. Alas, I found myself in her dms after she posted a question story about other‚Äôs mental ailments, and we started talking at around 5 pm. We talked about many things, mostly our mental health, and we eventually became incredibly open to each other and shared the roots of how we were. Before I knew it, it was 2 am and I was tired, emotional and needed to sleep. 

She understood so much about me and I understood so much about her. I‚Äôd show her my drawings and she‚Äôd read me her poetry, and we‚Äôd talk about our problems and support each other. That is what helped me survive through that Christmas: a solid friend. Without her, I‚Äôd be dead. I‚Äôd be another casualty to the mind.

Please always remember, our brains are incredibly complicated, as they would need to be for the complexity of humans. The drawback is that dealing with the mind is not a one person job. It always needs outer support. 

The good support can be found if you look for it and are willing to be mutual with the support. If anything, look for other people to support. Someone in need can often support you back, benefiting everyone."

2172,depression,I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm good at socializing.,"I‚Äôm concise, I explain myself well when topics are brought up. But I don‚Äôt know how to carry a conversation with new people. It bothers me. At the end of the day I know I‚Äôm not an engaging conversationalist and it effectively cuts off any potential new friends or connections I could have had if I knew how to feign enough interest in someone. 

Consequently I know my Friend isn‚Äôt interested in my day or what I want to rant about either. I always get the feeling that she‚Äôs there but isn‚Äôt listening. It gets pretty lonely talking to yourself with someone else right there. Don‚Äôt get me wrong she has good intentions. She‚Äôll stay on the phone with me if I had a bad day, she just doesn‚Äôt really care about the topics I bring up. 

Socializing becomes exhausting. I‚Äôm not very confident about making new connections. When I was unemployed a year ago I literally didn‚Äôt speak for 2 months. When I got a job I had to work on getting volume back in my voice because of it. I know it‚Äôs bad. If people don‚Äôt reach out to me I don‚Äôt talk. I recognize that it isn‚Äôt healthy. But I feel so drained when I make efforts to reach out and I‚Äôm not really heard. So I don‚Äôt."
2173,depression,The Heaviness of Depression,"Being 42 sucks. Being 42 and living in Detroit. Being 42, living in Detroit, and in the middle of a pandemic. Wait. Add on continuous unnecessary drama. Drama at home, traveling to work, at work, the cycle goes on. The arcades are my ONLY source of happiness in real life... they were closed for months and I had struggled with myself. They are open now, but I can only get to go on Wednesdays. Once I leave from the arcade, things start going down slowly and by Friday the mood goes south, fast. 5 hours at work will feel like 9 and even worse when there are days with a lot of heaviness in me.

Online: Some days are okay but most are meh. Maybe because I take roleplaying to heart, deeply. When you feel like crap in real life sometimes you take the RP world to heart, and when things go wrong there, my mood tanks to the cellar in a heartbeat. It‚Äôs even worse when you sleep on it, and you have to work through the visions and all.

During a few of those tanked days I had a lot of bad visions. One was when the I-75 bridge over the Rouge River collapsed, and I was falling to my doom. The other was me standing on Evergreen Road, at the bridge over the Northwestern Freeway, looking down. I had the vision of me falling down on the freeway. Somehow I shook my head and went onward.

I‚Äôve had a lot of feelings of being worthless. They go away with days at the arcade, easy. Problem is: very few are open, I only get one day, and it‚Äôs hard to keep the positive vibes beyond the arcade. Roleplaying doesn‚Äôt help too much unless I‚Äôm some high level magical being who can shoot lasers and destroy enemies. Hence I used to watch a lot of anime and superhero movies, now I can‚Äôt. Then RP partners who can bring such adventures are literally as hard as getting a Royal Flush in Texas Hold ‚ÄòEm.

Most times I keep a lot of this to myself because of course I‚Äôm in the land of toxic positivity: you know, the ‚Äúman up‚Äù mentality... or the ‚Äútry other things‚Äù thing: which is kinda ironic seeing it is Detroit - any civil form of entertainment is just the same rate as finding that Hold ‚ÄòEm Royal Flush.

Sometimes I wonder."

Everybody knows about the way she acts with boys. With every boy she sees. God I could just kill her. Please don't let her talk to the new boy again. I‚Äôm getting so dizzy now. I just want him to be mine but I can‚Äôt confront him.   And she's also in the same class as the new boy. I wonder if they talk in um. There's no way he would want to talk to her.

2183,depression,Frustrating discovery.,"FYI, this post does talk abt some sex stuff so click away if that makes you uncomfortable. I‚Äôm trying to be vague but that‚Äôs honestly all it‚Äôs about.



So I recently discovered that having difficulty ‚Äòfinishing‚Äô is a side affect of depression. I‚Äôm a trans guy, not on testosterone, so you can probably guess enjoying myself is a little awkward at times. Over time I‚Äôve trudged past dysphoria and am super sex positive, know how to try and focus on my pleasure, but can rarely ever finish. And by that I mean it‚Äôs been three times in the year I‚Äôve been trying. Yeah. I don‚Äôt currently have a partner and haven‚Äôt been intimate with one in the past, so it‚Äôs just me myself and I haha. If I try out a toy or whatever I don‚Äôt want to feel like I have a ‚Äòreliance‚Äô on it. Is there anything wrong with needing some extra help in that department? (Since I‚Äôm not in a relationship rn I‚Äôve not even going to TRY worrying about partnered sex)"

2185,depression,i don't understand what i am going through," 

I feel empty, I spend my days overthinking, and because of this I am stuck in a vicious cycle of stress and insomnia. I feel tired all the time and sometimes I find myself asking if living is really worth it. I constantly think about killing myself because anything is better than what I go through. Because of my state of mind dying must feel like going to sleep on a very cold night, the type of night where it's raining and you are wrapped comfortably in your duvet with little to no worries or stress. What i am writing might seem like a shock to people who think they know me but I am not a happy person. I may act happy or look happy but it's all just a front.

I  feel disconnected from society and everyone in general. The easiest way I can explain it is being trapped in your home while life passes you by. I sometimes feel like I am peering in from a window, not able to interact or connect with anyone.

I do not understand my feelings or anyone else's feelings. Most of the time I feel blank and the only emotions I have felt for a long time was intense sorrow. 

This sorrow I felt was like being wrapped by a giant monster. I try to turn around but the fear and sorrow is too much and it's like the presence of it causes me suffering and I haven't even faced it.

I think it is the years of me avoiding emotions causing them to build up, I recently started noticing that I go through great lengths to avoid anything that will make me feel any emotions."
2186,depression,I think I need help,"I was finally dumped by my ex more than a month ago after a lot of months of being on and off and it was good at first. I felt like we were better of without each other, and I would find someone better. But lately I‚Äôve started to miss him a lot and I tried reaching out him yesterday after a month of No Contact. Surprisingly he replied and Then I realized it was a big mistake cause this made me realize i was still in love with him. He dumped me because he doesn‚Äôt want to settle down and having a family soon isnt anywhere in his plan. I told him I‚Äôll wait for him no matter how long its gonna take. He still says no.
Idk what to do anymore, We‚Äôve only been together for a little over a year but I really thought he was my soulmate. Im starting to get suicidal thoughts now, even though Ik that wont change the reality it still seems like the only way I could get some peace.
If anyone is/has been going through something similar, any advice is appreciated"
2187,depression,I'm so fucking tired of people romanticizing mental illness,"I hate seeing kids on twitter who think it's ""cool"" To have adhd or ""quirky"" To have depression. The newest mental illness I've seen being faked is DID. People think it's cool to have multiple personalities and basically these kids end up making OCs and say it's their other personalities. It's honestly infuriating because even besides social media people irl will feign mental illness in hopes of getting pity from others and it makes me so angry. I just hate it when people fake shit for pity in general. One time a girl at my school commited suicide and almost every girl in the school was saying ""omg she was my best friend"" No she fucking wasn't! The only reason they were saying that was so they could get ""victum by association"" Status because by being associated with her they are also victims of her suicide and was just trying to get pity from others and honestly it's sickening. I remember talking to my sister about it and she said I was ""judging how they cope"" And i told her that it seems very unlikely that the majority of the girls at my high school were ""best friends"" With this girl. My school has over 5000 students so it's honestly very unlikely that they were best friends with her but it's people like my sister who make it even worse they just feed into the pity bait and pity them and enable them to keep doing that shit. People will automatically just pity anyone because they want to look good they don't actually care about the person they are pitying they just don't want to be seen as the bad guy. But when people question the legitimacy of their claims you get called a ""gatekeeper"". I have actual mental illnesses and it's not fun at all in fact it's hell. Some people think hyper fixation is ""cool"" When i hyper fixate on shit it's genuinely terrible i end up not leaving my room or showering and just focusing on that one thing or I can't shut up about whatever I'm hyper fixating on and it annoys people around me it's not some fun quirky thing. I know mental illness affects everyone differently but to an extent it's kinda ridiculous for the type of shit some people will pull. Like for example over using trigger warnings is so fucking annoying I'm tired of seeing people making triggers over the dumbest shit. And the reason why they do it is to act like a victim I'm tired of people trying to victimize themselves or trying to act like they have trauma. Not everyone has trauma and it's just so shitty to act like you have trauma just for pity. People like this just piss me off. I hope I'm not the only person who realizes how terrible like this are."

Reading the first two posts will give better context, but I'll give a quick run down. I met a girl on reddit, we became a couple, we both have mental illness but hers is a lot worse along with her trauma, I'm doing the best I can think of to help her but I'm still worried. Anyways, so after I went on a drunken rant about how her problems are important and that she's not a bad person or a burden, I feel like I've inadvertently reinforced her beliefs. I have had very similar beliefs, but mine mainly stemmed from myself, whereas hers stems from her experiences and traumas. So while I am now doing much better now that I have her, she still is struggling. She's still alive which I'm very grateful for, I sobbed into my pillow for almost 20 mins when I got her first text. The problem is that at this point I feel like she's exclusively living because she thinks I'll be hurt if she killed herself. I was in the exact same situation as her before I met her, and from experience it's only a matter of time before she decides that dying is better for me than living. I got better by opening up to her, but in return I feel like she's closed off to me. She thinks that her problems don't matter and that they cause nothing but pain to me, and no matter how much i tell her otherwise I can't seem to change her mind. Before we got close, I feel like we were much more open because there werent any stakes, but now that we're together I think she doesn't want to tell me any of her problems out of fear of hurting me or driving me away. She has really bad abandonment issues, and had awful experiences with her past boyfriends, and I feel like these also play a major factor. Another part of it is that when i got drunk yesterday, I was doing dumb shit and giggling before she said that she only bothers me and wanted to go to sleep. I feel like even though I tried to explain how I feel to her, all she understood is that I was having a fun time before I talked to her and then I was sad. Even today, I wanted to watch a movie with her, but she couldnt until her mom went to sleep and said I should just go to sleep. I told her i want to watch the movie and spend time with her, and she kept refusing until i said I was going to stay up anyways and I might as well watch the movie with her if I will. I want to have her understand somehow that helping her with her problems and letting her vent and spending time with me isn't hurting me in the slightest, I'm the happiest i've been since early elementary school. Yeah it pains me to hear the horrible things she's been through, but it also makes me much more happy in return that I was able to help her and provide support by listening to her problems. I just want to have her understand that somehow. My current plan is to tell her about how I feel in what I've wrote, and that I understand if she doesn't want to open up to me and I will never force her to, but I will always be here for her and that she should know that."

2190,depression,"There's just nothing left for me, I'll never do any of the things I want to, I'll never be free of depression, I'll keep living this exact same shit over and over for the rest of my life","I had dreams once upon a time like anyone else but it doesn't matter now, I'm only 22 but all of them are already impossible. I've ruined my chances of any of them, I've fallen down the wrong path and sometimes you really can't turn back. I won't ever create any of the things I want to, I'll never travel or see any place I want to, I'll never fall in love, never be noteworthy in any way to anyone.



I thought I'd help people, I thought I'd write music or books or make art that people care about, or I thought I'd be a scientist who could help move us forward, I thought I could do SOMETHING. You hear about artists who go through hardships and turn that into creative energy to make amazing things, even if in the moment they were just trying to express themselves. My depression just kills me, I can't do anything, I've essentially given up on music and writing and anything else because I just can't be bothered. I'm stupid and dropped out of college and don't care about science or anything anymore. I just do drugs, sleep and eat and I'm just a shell of who I used to be, and so fucking far from even my LEAST ambitious goal that it's laughable. 


I USED to be smart, creative, charismatic, ambitious, hopeful but what you *used to be* years ago really isn't relevant. 



I won't ever be anyone or do anything that matters, even to one person. I do nothing, I don't even talk to anyone because I just can't. I can't do anything. Any and all energy I ever had has been gone for close to 10 years now.




And now it's led me to a place where definitely none of that shit is possible, I'm just self destructing and I even realize it and see it happening but can't be bothered to care. I've already burned countless bridges and many things already are actually impossible now. I know already but especially further down this path I'll never be desirable to anyone, I'll never achieve anything, never matter at all but again I just can't be bothered to care.



I'll be doing the same shit every day for the rest of my life like everybody else and none of it will matter, to me or anyone else. Soulless, mindless I'm just existing. I go to work where I know I'm just a machine for a $100 billion corporation, then go home, get high, eat, drink, cry, whatever it may be that numbs me in the moment. Repeat tomorrow. 



No goals, dreams, ambitions, plans, desires, anything anymore. My only identity is as a coulda woulda shoulda been and that'll only solidify even more as I go on. 



Don't even say therapy because that doesn't matter either. I've already given it everything. All that creative and ambitious energy I tried to channel into getting better, I tried so FUCKING hard to get better and only ever got worse. 6 therapists, probably 20 medications, psychiatrists, every program and group I could find, hospitalizations, none of it worked. Everyone including this sub likes to say therapy always works and it just absolutely doesn't. 





Lyrics that explain 


""They take your dreams down


And they stick 'em in storage


You can have 'em back, son


When you've paid off your mortgage and loans"" 



""Step into the shadows we could talk addiction,


 when it's harmful where you're going and the


 part of you that know it don't give a fuck"""
2191,depression,Need some tricks and tips :(,"I‚Äôve been living in this black hole for 3-4 years now and I am tired of living the same unhealthy routine everyday. I‚Äôm in this vicious cycle that never ends. I‚Äôve been ruining my health and my insides without taking any care of it, taking drugs everyday to ‚Äúmake myself forget about my problems‚Äù , being antisocial and not having friends/family members that are by side. Drugs are slowly killing me but it‚Äôs the only way I seem to forget about how unhealthy and disgusted I am by myself. I need help but I can‚Äôt seem to help myself because i‚Äôm afraid and ashamed of everything i‚Äôve done to myself and how toxic I am to myself. I miss multiple days of work cause I either hate myself, don‚Äôt want to talk to nobody or abused drugs to the point where I can‚Äôt get up the next day.

Nobody bothers to ask me how I am and think i‚Äôm doing very well in life cause i‚Äôm a happy, caring, (try to be positive) kind of person and try my best to help people around me without thinking and being selfish to myself. I want to be healthy again and gain my strength back enough to make a routine everyday. I want to be able heal every broken pieces of me from the inside out and hopefully find a partner one day when i‚Äôm on the right side of the map. 

How does one manage to get better? I start something one day and can‚Äôt seem to keep going on the next. I‚Äôve tried to eat healthy and stop fucking my insides up but can‚Äôt go day without eating junk food that i‚Äôm intolerant to. I don‚Äôt thank the people who are close to me and just think about taking drugs and ruining myself.

They won't even talk to the depressed, because it burst their shallow little bubble or force them to admit they're only happy because they're taking what others need with little effort, or in other words, they're parasites on society.  The next time you see a happy person, you should smack them.  They probably deserve it right that second."

in those moments of silence once the momentary distraction has parted ways with me, i realize that i did not even care about whatever mindless activity i was indulging in.

 i also recognize that anything i make myself do from that point on will be just as unsatisfying. nothing that i ever do will make me feel more than nothing. that's all i am and ever will be... nothing."

2203,depression,I feel so lost and unable. I just need someone to listen.,"I graduated college a year ago. I suffered from depression throughout college, but I went through with it because everyone, including my therapist, just told me that it will get better after I graduate... that therapist is no longer my therapist. I thought that the consistent mental difficulty I was experiencing was just because of the massive, unending work load that my education was putting on me. I thought that after I graduated with this big shot degree that I would wake up to a whole new world of confidence and opportunity. Maybe that confidence and opportunity is there, but my brain is too fogged out with depression to see it right in front of my face. 

A year has gone by since I achieved that degree, and I‚Äôm having an extremely difficult time adjusting to my new life. I haven‚Äôt found a job that relates to my degree because I hated the education so much that I thought there was no way in hell I was going to put myself in a career of the same subject, so I lowballed for a construction job because I thought I would like it. Do I like it? I don‚Äôt know. My body doesn‚Äôt seem to like it, I don‚Äôt like the pay, and I‚Äôm constantly terrified of doing something wrong. Thinking about something as simple as making a wrong cut on a piece of wood will ruin the next couple hours for me. 

I have no idea where I want to go in life or what I want to do. I‚Äôm always afraid of never being able to find my place in life, never succeeding, never being paid what I deserve, never being able to be free from work and the endless grind... but I‚Äôm too afraid to make a step that‚Äôll help me in those areas. Not only that, but I‚Äôm so lost that I don‚Äôt even know where to step. I‚Äôm 23 now, I‚Äôll be 24 in a month. Most of my friends have found nice jobs that pay well, and they‚Äôre doing awesome engineering stuff because they‚Äôre smart as hell. I‚Äôm left feeling like a failure because I can‚Äôt seem to force myself to do the things that‚Äôll lead to a more successful life. Depression has overloaded my mental capacity for so many years I feel like I‚Äôm losing an intellectual ability to function normally. 

My hair is thinning out, I forget things, I can‚Äôt do simple math in my head. I can‚Äôt learn new things. When I fail at something I hyperbolize it to the extreme and I can‚Äôt recover from it for an unnecessary amount of time. I can‚Äôt enjoy games very much anymore because not knowing how to do something will send me in a fit and I‚Äôll quit it all together. The thought of work will send my heart through the roof for no damn reason. My dad just retired at 53 from a successful engineering career and while I‚Äôm happy for him, my jealousy is immeasurable because I feel like I‚Äôll never be as satisfied and happy with a path in life like he is. 

I feel like my only redeeming quality is that I have a partner that cares and listens to me, god forbid my depression drives her away. Bless her heart. 

I look out on this society we live in and see people working their monotonous jobs their entire life just to barely pay their bare expenses, simple ambulance rides that bring people to bankruptcy, capitalistic architecture that leaves most people begging for scraps. It brings me to tears. I‚Äôm at the bottom of it with so many others who will most likely never claw their way out from the bottom.

I just feel lost and hopeless. I have no idea what the future will bring but I am almost never positive about it, I don‚Äôt know how I can be."
2204,depression,I don‚Äôt know if I have depression or if I am just depressed,"I don‚Äôt know if I have depression. I don‚Äôt want to live but I don‚Äôt want to die. Every time I walk in the kitchen and see a knife I think about how easy suicide would be compared to just living life. Same thing happens when I‚Äôm waking down a road and could jump in front of a truck or a train. I have a fucked up brain.

I don‚Äôt struggle to get out of bed, I also don‚Äôt sleep. I don‚Äôt cry often. I don‚Äôt exactly feel sad. I do feel angry a lot. When my family starts talking I just want to scream at them, especially my mum. I know they mean well but they need to focus on themselves. My mum is a heavy, heavy smoker and compulsive liar. My brother, almost 13, is never at school. My sister is a year younger than my brother and is just a horrible person. Extremely selfish and not the typical ‚Äúbeing a kid‚Äù selfish. They all lie about trying to improve themselves, they‚Äôre always ‚Äútrying‚Äù but they never do.

I want to leave but my siblings behaviour will just get worse living with our mum. When my sister lived with only me for a few months she was a whole different person. A lovely, sweet, kind and caring young girl. After my nana passed in November my mum and brother moved back home and things are worse than ever.

I don‚Äôt sleep anymore, not that I did much before. I feel nothing without a pill or bottle of the cheapest alcohol I can get, usually a 1.5L Smirnoff that doesn‚Äôt last long. I don‚Äôt even have a job. I ‚Äústole‚Äù the money (its complicated, its technically my money) to get me fucked up for a few days near Christmas. I‚Äôve been dealing to get some money for more pills and booze, and to save for my brother and sister. I don‚Äôt want to be selfish with the money. I know the way I‚Äôm getting it is wrong and I hate myself for it but I can‚Äôt find a job.

I dropped out of school in grade 10 and I was truant since I started kindergarten. I always did well in school though. I have ‚Äútried‚Äù finishing school for years but I never attend classes. I know if given the exams I can pass but I never make it that far. It pains me to see my siblings walk a similar path. I figured I would be able to help guide them in the right direction at least but my mum steers them the opposite way.

So, I don‚Äôt know if I have depression or if my living situation is just making me depressed. I don‚Äôt even know how to find out. This is all I have known for at least 10 years.

I should go to a doctor but I don‚Äôt see how they could say that I do or don‚Äôt have depression without me moving away and that‚Äôs not possible at this point.

That was a long rant."

2206,depression,I need help,"Life has been a little rough lately. I've never had these issues before and they kind of hit me like a truck. I've typically been a perfect student all of my life and online instruction has finally taken its toll on me. My grades dropped to F's and it feels like years of work to catch up.

2207,depression,My life is completely falling apart,"This has been the most fucked up few weeks of my life, and I really need somewhere to get this off my chest. Im 19 years old, and I have suffered with depression for quite a few years but the past couple of weeks have been hell on earth. A few days before Christmas, I unknowingly smoked some laced weed which had 'K2 Spice' in it, a very messed up drug that basically turned me into a zombie for the entire Christmas and New Years period. I was violently ill and a paramedic had to come out to help, and now I have little to no recollection of 2020 other than some very vague memories which is incredibly scary for me. 

This incident has caused me to miss out on my college deadlines which might stop me from being able to get into university, and has made me forget pretty much everything that I had learned at college. Its also stopped me from working and affected my relationship with my family, who now think that I'm some kind of actual drug user instead of just the occasional weed joint that I would sometimes have before, and keep as a secret since I'm not proud of it.

My life is screwed, my head feels so foggy and messed up and I'm feeling more depressed than I have ever been before, what the hell am I supposed to do now? Anyone got any advice for someone recovering from spice use? Thanks for reading."
2208,depression,I just need someone to talk to,I end up posting on all my social medias when I get sad (and admittedly drunk) but what I need is someone to talk to. On socials people like even when they don't wanna talk. Anyone here wanna talk?
2209,depression,I accpeted a part of myself,"So I drink pretty regularly but I'm very careful to not let it affect my life. I told myself I would quit drinking after the new year but yesterday I thought to myself ""why?"". Even during heavy drinking times I make sure I never drink the day before work or plans with friends/family. Why deprive myself of a source of pleasure when it doesn't negatively affect my life?

A small victory but a victory over the brain demons nonetheless."

Everything I do is wrong. I can‚Äôt find happiness and everything is just so hard. I mess up everything I touch and I upset my parents constantly. I think it would just be better if I was gone. I can‚Äôt do anything right and there‚Äôs no point in me being here anymore."

I don‚Äôt have something to be ‚Äúfixed.‚Äù I‚Äôm not ungrateful by your views on religion, because they aren‚Äôt mine. I just want to be myself somewhere. Talk about my day without getting sugary pep talks back, like someone flashing a light right into your eyes. Somewhere I‚Äôm not alone.

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a better word for that than ‚Äúdepression.‚Äù For me, it‚Äôs just being human though? And being around people who don‚Äôt feel the same way is like walking on eggshells. Being force-fed religion is exhausting. That‚Äôs what truly does me harm to my well-being, having to cloak my words in consolation for those who would be offended by the fact that I‚Äôm just not happy, nor am I ashamed of it.

I just want somewhere somber and muted...Cozy. And simple as I am. Blunt? Surely I‚Äôm not alone in this. Just let me be shrek. I need a swamp.

2216,depression,Please help," I fucking hate myself so much. Everything hurts. Every single day I wake up and lay in bed for nearly an hour just trying to deal with the fact that I have to go through another day and amass enough energy even to stand up. I‚Äôve been depressed for the past 6 years and tried to kill myself a year ago. The worst part is I don‚Äôt even know why I constantly feel so awful. Even at the ‚Äúhighest‚Äù point of my life, where my grades were perfect, I was working out on the daily, eating a healthy diet, consistently interacting with my family and friends, I still despised myself and life. Even now, most things are the same, I just workout less often and don‚Äôt eat as well, so then why the fuck do I feel so bad? If everything in my life sounds good, why the fuck does it feel so bad. Every single day I wake up dreading the day. My family loves me, I have plenty of genuine, amazing friends, but everything fucking hurts so bad, and I can‚Äôt take it anymore. Every single day feels like torture and all I want to do every single day is just try to kill myself again. I don‚Äôt matter, in 500 years no one will remember me, and all we are is a speck floating through space, so what the fuck is the point? Why the fuck should I deal with this fucking stupid pain that has followed me for the past six years for what? I feel so fucking entitled for being so lucky, having loving family and friends, always having food in the house and always having a roof over my head, and yet I‚Äôm still suffering for some fucking reason. I‚Äôm also terrified of the next few years of my life. Trying to get into a good college, and trying to find what I should be doing in life, and using another four years of my life in miserable school. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs stopped me in the past from just drinking myself to death, and I‚Äôm scared because soon I‚Äôll be able to drive and I don‚Äôt know what will stop me from just swerving into an oncoming car and ending it there. I don‚Äôt get it, I don‚Äôt get myself, I don‚Äôt understand people, I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm like this. Even when I try my absolute hardest to just tell people about this, I don‚Äôt know why, but I just can‚Äôt. Even one of my friends who was essentially the only person who knew who I really felt and that I attempted suicide I now just can‚Äôt tell how I still feel no matter how hard I try. I‚Äôve also manifested this disgusting concept of happiness, where I feel like the only key to it is for a girl to love me, which leads to me borderline obsessing over girls who I‚Äôve barely talked to and don‚Äôt know well. Thank god I haven‚Äôt done like real creepy shit yet, it‚Äôs essentially just daydreaming about dating them, but I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs going to get worse in the future and I won‚Äôt have the self awareness to see what I‚Äôm doing.

2219,depression,Doesn't this place hurt you a little bit?,"I understand that for most of us, the primary feeling we experience at our worst is lonelyness. And it can help to know that there are others out there going through the same thing.

But for me, seeing it all stings horribly. Witnessing the fact that the world has made so many others feel this way is proof enough that no matter what walk of life you come from, it will still take you. Listening to people that have been struggling for their entire lives if proof enough that no matter how long you hold out, it will still take you.

The horror at realising that so many people can relate to these feelings I have make me want to throw up. It's not suppossed to be this way. I hate that you all have to suffer this way, too. I hate all we can do for each other is ruminate about how shitty things are and will continue to be. It's cruel enough that I ended up this way, but it's unspeakable that so many others have too.

This sub is a very good place that *needs* to exist, but I can't get over the mixed feelings it gives me. On one hand: validation and community. I get to feel as though I am not alone. We are all trapped, but at least we are trapped together. On the other hand: overwelming despair and rage at the futility of the situation. The realization that, no matter what, the world will always push people to become like this. The heartbreak that there are hundreds of thousands of us, suffering with no end in sight. And all we can do it swap scars and hope that it gets better for even one of us. I hate witnessing all this despair and seeing that it eclipses the meager sadness that I've felt in my life. Couple that with the fact that I can't do anything to help and the whole thing seems so hopeless."

As for movement I can walk and everything but I get really sore really easy.

2225,depression,I dont want to kill myself yet but i have no idea how to continue and live life again. Ideas are much appreciated and needed.,"TLDR: i am completely alone in life living by myself, suffer from mentall illnesses and have zero idea to what to do in life. How to continue?

I dont know whats the point of my post. I guess this is just a rant.
I am 24M living alone without gf, friends or family.
I have depression, ADHD, anhedonia, OCD and derealization. My biggest moments in my days are
1. When i shower
2. and when i go to the grocery store
Other than that i just lay on my bed watching movies and videos. 

Only useful thing i do is that i run 5 times a week on my treadmill to lose weight and to feel better. I have been overweight for two years now. Gained 50kg in two years because of depression. But i dont think losing weight is going to help me much because i was severely depressed at a healthy weight.

I have tried ~10 different kinds of medications for depression, OCD and anxiety. Nothing helps with this weird emptiness feeling. This ‚Äùvoid‚Äù i call it. I have tried SSRIs, SNRIs, NDRI, benzos and few ADHD medications. Nothing helps. Therapy doesnt help me either. Not at all. I have tried 4 different kinds of them. Its advices are basically ‚Äùfake it till you makeit‚Äù and i never learn anything i dont already know there.

I dont know what to do in life anymore. I just feel that i want to drink my worries away every night. Im not addicted but drink few times a week because im going crazy from the loneliness and the boderom.

I feel like i cant study or go to work anymore. What can i do in life? I would make a bet that depression has made severe and permanent damage to my brain.
I dont want to kill myself yet but i dont see any other way."
2226,depression,I am wasting people's time.,I am a burden. It's time I removed myself from the equation.
2227,depression,"If it constantly comes and goes, is it really depression?","Right now I feel fine. Despite the dreadful feeling that I'll have to leave my home and go to uni with the situation the UK is in right now, I'd say the past month was alright. I had therapy somewhere around the beginning of December for the last time and I almost couldn't say anything bad because I was in such a good state of mind.
However, it has happened before. I'm good for a week, month, even a whole season and on the back of my mind there's always something telling me I should worry, but I'm 100% capable to ignore it. Then, in just a day or two, I become numb - like emotions, people, world events, news don't touch me at all, it's like I'm living in a little glass cage and the world around me is just scenery I get to look at but not feel or touch. That's when my mind kind of shuts down and I become a shell, like I talk to people and laugh and clean and cook and study but nothing touches me. It doesn't feel like that right now, but I feel it creeping in, probably like a defence reaction against the change of scenery when I go back to uni.
And I can't help but feel guilty. If I get to have good moments, am I really allowed to be depressed? Do I get an ""unfair advantage""? I'm confused, but at the same time I still go to therapy and I'm afraid it's like I'm not supposed to? I want to feel heard, that's all, but I can't if I'm feeling numb. Right now would be the best time to talk about this, but my next session isn't until the middle of January. So I decided to write here. Sorry if this is too chaotic, I can't really wrap my mind around it."

2229,depression,I got my heart broken and failed 3/4 of my university units this year.,"Here goes. I need help. 

I've been doing nothing for the past two months. I'm in holiday break from university. 

This year in 2020, I really struggled. 

Mid-way through the year, I found out that the guy I was dating, was already dating someone else, during the time period when he said he was ""still interested in me but needed space and time"". It really broke me when I found out. I didn't eat for days and didn't have the motivation to do anything. 

That really knocked the wind out of me. It had an effect on my grades. It didn't really help that this was by far the hardest units I've taken so far in uni. 

I worked so damn hard throughout the year. I was in so much stress. At the end of it all, it wasn't enough. I failed 3/4 of my units. 

But you know what, I tried my best. There was nothing more I could do. But still. That launched into an even greater depression. Where ive just been at home for two months doing nothing. All of my plans this break, just disappeared. 

But I'm trying to pick myself up. First was journalling my feelings like this. It really has helped me. I'm also reaching out to people, and telling them how I feel. Getting help us good."
2230,depression,Is this really depression?,"I still laugh. Laugh a lot. I have a job, stays with family, have some friends which I share my crappy, lame humour with. I can play games with others, just recently fallen out of love because I was low-key rejected but we're still friends in the same social group.

But when I'm alone, I cant really smile. I laugh at memes and jokes, and watches funny vids too. But I don't feel..happy. I feel as though I'm hollow, that I'm lonely and just very anxious or fear or even just sad. But my friends and family don't ever know about this, I hide it really well like I put up the best smile outside and laugh the loudest but deep down, I feel really empty. 

I don't even know what this is? Is this really depression? It's not like I can't socialise, and I still work and communicate with others and my colleagues often but no matter what I do, I feel so empty deep down. Like it's just hollow and nothing I do fits into it."

I'm sorry but I'm really starting to wonder what the point of this all is. Some ideas I've wanted to use for such a long time but I've always been afraid to, because that's how anxiety works.

2253,depression,The thought that I used to care about myself,"I'm just sitting here, in the midst of another bout of depression, thinking about times when I used to care about myself more, or at least the way I was perceived. In high school I would actually get myself ready for bed and wake up in the morning with the intent of going about my day. I would fix my hair and put on makeup (makeup obviously is not necessary to start one's day - but it was something that made my mornings complete). Sure, it's not like I was lacking for mental health issues in high school. 

But it's so strange to me right now, 10 years later, depressed and struggling with executive function, that there was a time when I cared about myself getting ready for bed instead of passing out at whatever time I do in the same day's clothes. Making meals for myself and eating at certain times of day instead of just snacking on processed foods all day. Getting ready for the day instead of waiting days to shower because I don't have the energy. 

Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get that back. How will it feel?"

I've been trying to take better care of my mental health recently, so I've decided to see a therapist, first was the psyche dr to get my meds sorted (I was already on meds but just through my pcp) I had just gone through a huge loss in my life and needed to increase my meds to compensate, so I had to tell him everything that's happened to me from childhood to now, then he recommended a therapist and I accepted, then during the first appointment with the therapist (intake) I had to do it yet again, then that therapist said he wasn't taking any new patients as he was going on vacation in 2 weeks, so he recommended his colleague who was a therapist that dealt with patients suffering from the trauma I was suffering from, when that appointment came I yet again had to tell the whole story...

2256,depression,What‚Äôs wrong with me? Pls help,"I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs ADD, depression, anxiety, or a combination of all 3 but my mental health has been bad for a little over a year (again). I got on an SSRI recently and although it‚Äôs kinda helped with my anxiety, my depression almost seems to be worse (don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm going to speak to my doctor about this). What really concerns me and bums me out is the fact that I can‚Äôt accomplish anything. I over-think everything so much that I end up doing nothing. I wake up instantly feeling overwhelmed/overstimulated and usually go straight on my phone. Constantly searching things as I‚Äôm constantly thinking, never being able to finish reading certain articles and posts as I‚Äôve started thinking about something else, constantly having so many tabs open. Is this normal? A lot of times I feel so overwhelmed I end up just sitting on the couch and watch Netflix. How do I become more productive? I like the idea of doing more and I used to do more! Used to always go out with friends/by myself to restaurants, concerts, on hikes/camping trips  but it‚Äôs been so hard lately. I stopped drinking about two years ago and noticed I‚Äôm so much more introverted sober. Or maybe I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôm more depressed? Anyway, I always tell myself at night that tomorrow will be different; I even make a to-list in my notes app but it never gets started.. or at least finished.I‚Äôm I that weak minded? Or lazy? Does anyone else feel this way or is there something seriously wrong with me? I‚Äôm so embarrassed that I‚Äôve become this way.

2259,depression,"I don't want help, comfort or pity. I just want to get some shit off my mind.","I thought I was getting better. Haven't posted here since a year ago. But now, I'm not so sure. I went from exasperated to indifferent, and now... pathetic.

All I am is a burden. I have tired out people, tired out friends in the past with my incessant sobbing and bitching. I'm tiring people out now as I speak, I'm sure. I'm certain that I'll be tiring out people in the future.

People out there have it so much worse than me. I don't have to worry about not having a roof over my head. I don't have to worry about not being able to afford my insulin. I don't have to worry about not having food on my plate, or even worrying about crooked teeth. I have a part time job. I got into college. I have friends, albeit few. I have access to entertainment, beyond my wildest imaginations. I have things that are considered a luxury for many unfortunate people.

And yet, I am miserable. I bitch about how gloomy and moody I am. I bitch about how I lack motivation or will to live. I bitch about being ugly. I give out sob stories that no one gives a rat's ass about. I bitch about how useless, annoying, and straight up weird I am, and I bitch about how being around me fucking sucks, despite the fact that I'm the one who makes it so. I've always got a frown on my face, and I'm always talking about morbid things.

I don't deserve anything I have, and I know it. I'm an ingrate. Whatever short time I have left, I wish I could give out to those who really need, and want it. I tire out everyone with my constant complaining, and everybody leaves me, rightfully so. I don't deserve comfort, much less happiness and love.

I often think how much of a good deed killing myself would be. I've already had 6 attempts since 2017. I'm so much of a failure, that I can't even kill myself properly. My insurance might be voided if I attempt another time, so I'm hesitant at having another attempt. All because I'm too much of a bitch to die. Every time I try, it scares me shitless. I'm the most pathetic, lowest, sorriest thing you'll see out there. I hold nor contribute no value to anyone in my life. 

I just needed to get that confession out there, because I know people don't care here. After all, I can't hurt, or even be an inconvenience to those who don't care, right? I know it sounds mean, but I don't want to hurt anyone I care about. I can't have them walk out on me again, like so many in the past have.

If you're still reading this, take care, because I'm not sure I will."

2265,depression,Turning my life around,"I know the span of this throwaway account's ramblings hasn't been that big, but I've made a huge leap in my recovery, and that is **being inspired to actually get shit done.** I've made a whole list of goals, I'm going to dissect every one and make them more digestible within the next few days, until I have a huge organized list that I can compartmentalize. Instead of pissing and moaning and feeling sorry for myself here, I'm going to document my progress every once in a while. Hopefully others can gain inspiration from what I share

Though I am excited about this, I'm also kind of confused, so this is both an announcement and a small vent/dump of thoughts. Just yesterday I was so depressed I relapsed. The regret and self-hatred and guilt from that built up through this entire day until suddenly I had this weird clarity. I knew using healthier vices and improving my habits would help my depression from the get-go, but everything just seems to click now for no reason. A part of me is concerned this'll only be temporary, and that even if I'm extremely careful not to overwork myself into burnout with my ambitions for recovery, I'll still lose traction over time. I can only have faith that won't happen, and even though it's odd that I suddenly *do* have faith, I'm glad I have it. I wanna ask though... has anyone else here had this happen? A weird rush of inspiration to do better against all odds? Did it end up working out? Is it a sign of something more sinister?

I've been depressed and have had suicidal thoughts for a while now. It all started when my girlfriend dumped me at a time when I was the happiest I had ever been. I felt that I could just take some time to recollect myself in the first few weeks of school since I probably wouldn't get a bunch of homework. That was a mistake.

2280,depression,Help,"Sorry for the wall of text. I don't know what to do. TLDR at bottom.

I asked this girl out to homecoming in September 2018. She rejected me, it stung, but my problems would get much worse. I started believing that everyone in the whole school thought I took a picture of her ass. I didn't. I told my mom about it (I'm a fucking pussy I know) and she just kinda justified my feelings, called other kids assholes, believing my interpretations were right. I realized like 3-4 weeks later that It wasn't true. Then, I started believing that I did this to my sister. That I took a picture of her ass. To be clear, i had a memory of me doing it. I was making timelines, asking friends what happened around certain dates, checking through old pictures and texts on my phone to see if I could connect that event to anything else to verify it. I kept it a secret. I was suicidal all the time. This lasted roughly 5-6 months. From November 2018 to April 2019. I convinced myself it was a false memory. I started getting scared though. One time in class my teacher mentioned the mandela effect, which is (kinda) related to false memories. One time, I was making one of my timelines in statistics and a kid asked what it was. My teacher standing right next to him responded a timeline. I remember crying at the time when they asked. (I guess I thought I confirmed it) I wondered if they noticed. I know I was overthinking now, but I started to believe that my teachers and parents and other kids knew. And they had plotted it to make me a stronger person. At the time, I'm pretty sure I believed my teachers and parents knew but not other kids. While this was going on, I started believing that I was highly gifted and the other kids who are actually in it were there just to help me. The two who weren't were there just to throw me off.

After the false memory incident, I started to believe that I was narcissistic and then autistic. I thought I was on the spectrum and that everyone around me was trying to nudge me into having better social skills. I barged into my sister's room and yelled ""I'm autistic aren't I?"" In the middle of summer 2019. She denied it and it caused a scene in our household.

I'm going to cut this short. My overthinking has since mostly ended. I nearly flunked out my senior year of high school. I went away to college. My grade are not terrible but they're not great. It's 2021 now. Ever since the new year started it doesn't even feel like I'm human. 2021 doesn't look like a year to me, just a series of digits. My life is still hellish. I have a group of friends from high school that I play video games with but it ain't that great. I don't really like them anymore. They're not bad people, we are all flawed, but they can be pretty immature and frankly I feel like we're all just losers together. I can't be a loser in 2021. They just keep justifying it. I can't keep justifying it to myself. My one friend blames all of his problems on others, if the enemy wins in a game it's because they were lucky. (Perhaps I'm overthinking) Every damn time. My other friend joined the navy and is a complete dick to his roommate. His roommate can be a bit of a dick too, but my friend set his alarm really early just to get back at him for something minor he did. I don't really like being around them, but I need to find more people to be around.

Sorry for my sob story. The only thing I know right now is that 2021 cannot be anything like 2020 or 2019. Things must change. I might edit this thread or direct message anyone who comments on this thread at the end of this year as like a thing to see how much I've changed. 

TLDR : I'm at rock bottom. I have almost no friends, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm directionless.

I am usually very positive actually. I usually am like listen this is going to pass it will get better. This year basically killed my soul. I have never felt a depression like this. I feel like I have no way out. I looked to everyone I thought I could click with and enjoy my time since I‚Äôve been miserable and each person screwed me over. That‚Äôs not the worst.

2288,depression,(24F) I‚Äôve been feeling suicidal for so long and I don‚Äôt know if it will ever stop,"Edit: I have a shorter straight to the point version at the bottom.

I‚Äôm sorry in advance if this is long but I appreciate anyone who fully reads this. I would love some advice but would also love to hear others experiences to know I‚Äôm not alone. Please no direct messages, I‚Äôve already had too many encounters of redditors being inappropriate. If you‚Äôre someone who is lurking around this sub just looking for someone vulnerable to prey on, sincerely fuck you.

So I have always had some form of depression or anxiety for as long as I could remember. I was always reserved as a child and always found it hard to make friends. I always felt like a freak around others, like I wasn‚Äôt even a person sometimes. My suicidal thoughts invade my mind on a daily bases, especially when I start to think about the future and what I‚Äôm going to do. I still live at home and just graduated but I‚Äôm worried about not landing a job because of my lack of experience and because it is a male dominated field (mechanics). The only thing that seems to keep me grounded and not feeling completely invisible are my dog and cat. My dog is adopted and has severe anxiety especially around people. My kitten I found in my garage early October. I‚Äôll post the pet tax below. 

https://imgur.com/a/DjDIutF

But it especially hits when I start to have feelings for someone. In general my social anxiety isn‚Äôt as bad as it use to be, because of my distain for other humans I‚Äôve learn to just ignore them and not acknowledge them. Only if I‚Äôm being greeted by employees, old people, or children. Otherwise I keep my headphones in and eyes on my phone. But every now and then I‚Äôll see a guy who‚Äôs my type and all of a sudden this feeling of butterflies fluttering hit me followed by this weird high as a kite feeling. But not even a minute later reality sets in and it all comes crashing down. I will then have this overwhelming feeling of wanting to hide, my self awareness is heightened, and my self esteem just goes completely to shit. 

Then the suicidal feelings set in. The feeling of being unworthy, undesirable, ugly, and a freak. I‚Äôll feel this intense feeling of shame. My mind screams at me ‚Äúhow dare you have these feelings‚Äù, ‚Äúyou are a joke to think anyone could ever actually want you‚Äù, ‚Äúno one deserves to have to settle with such an ugly, plain, and obnoxious person like you‚Äù.

More and more of these thoughts will just pile on top of each other and it doesn‚Äôt stop. The only way to get it to stop is to just avoid being around men that I could potentially catch feelings for. But the worst part is that sometimes I‚Äôll be around a guy at work or school, and at first I won‚Äôt really feel attracted and things will be fine. We‚Äôll just start off as friends, but then if this guy shows any sort of human decency or kindness towards me I start to panic and have these feelings. I have to keep reminding myself that my feelings are wrong and that the guy would never want to be with me. I‚Äôll even have to give myself fake reasons to why he might actually be a bad person. I‚Äôll have to make up shit in my head that he might actually be abusive or a complete asshole behind closed doors. A wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing, no matter how genuine or sweet he might seem. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter how much I fall for the guy, I always force myself to shove it down and keep it hidden. I‚Äôve already been rejected enough times to learn my lesson. I‚Äôve only had one bf ever of 2 yrs, and it was miserable. He was barely 18 when I met him at work and I was 21. I know it sounds wrong but at the time he was the only guy ever to show interest and I was desperate. He started out nice but he was really into drugs and looking back I feel like he was really just using me financially and because he didn‚Äôt have a car or license. He started using heroine and couldn‚Äôt keep a job. He would get so high and tweaky that it felt like I was with a zombie. Once I finally broke up with him he turned it all on me, saying I never loved him, I was just using him (I don‚Äôt even know where this came from, I was basically his care taker). Whenever I would confront him about his issues he would always say that I had anger issues, a joy kill, and didn‚Äôt know about drugs like he did. He would always make me feel like the bad person and in return I would always feel guilty for being a bad gf and how I should have done better and more for him. I would even do some drugs with him to be the ‚Äúcool gf‚Äù. I did molly, lsd, xanax, and aderal. I was actually starting to get addicted to aderal because it made me feel normal but thankfully I was able to stop. He was dragging me down with him and I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. 

But he guilted me into staying friends with him for another year and would even asked me weird questions like if we would still be friends if I found a new bf, with I tell new boyfriend about him, and if I would leave the new bf if he didn‚Äôt approve of our friendship. Even if we weren‚Äôt together he was still being incredibly controlling and still wanted to be in my life. 

Even when I did start to date a new guy I met on bumble (didn‚Äôt last, dumped me after 4 months because he lost interest..) he wanted to know everything about the guy, like was he taller, cuter, how much he made and even was asked if he had a bigger dick and was better in bed (we never even had sex, he claimed he had a contagious health issue, not an std but I forgot what it was). I was in constant stress and just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and finally blocked him on everything. He tried to reach out to me again with a new number and when I told him once again that I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore and wanted to be left alone, he went on a tangent about how he was just trying to be nice and check on me, how I needed to see a psychologist for my anger issues and negativity, how he has a new gf that treats him way better than I ever did (he lied about that and in general I learned that he was just a serial liar), and how no one will ever care about me like he did. Well, he was right about one thing, no one since has ever cared about me...

We broke up about 2 years ago and since I‚Äôve only had sex with him... I dated a guy for 4 months and we kissed and saw each other naked but never had sex because of the reason above. Don‚Äôt know if it was true or if he just wasn‚Äôt attracted to me physically enough to even bother.. While I was in trade school I hung out with a classmate/friend that I was in class with for like a year. During that hangout I started to catch feelings and he actually invited me back to his place to watch anime. We were just sitting on his bed and slowly I was just saying that we could cuddle if he wanted and he agreed. I knew him well and knew that he was always dating/sleeping with girls so I thought that maybe he would want to be fwb (pathetic I know) and when I brought it up he seemed a little hesitant and said that he found me attractive. I didn‚Äôt say anything else and just assured him that if he wanted to it was fine. He turned to me and we started making out but when it came to do the deed he couldn‚Äôt get it up. He kept saying that it always happens the first time he is with someone and I just kept assuring him that it was totally fine. I didn‚Äôt want him to feel embarrassed so we just went back to cuddling. I know it sounds stupid but I just felt so horrible, that maybe he just couldn‚Äôt get turned on and just made something up to make me feel better.. I honestly felt like in a way I made him uncomfortable or like he felt like he had to do it to make me feel better. The next few days I apologized in a text about if I made him uncomfortable and if we could go back to hanging out as friends. He read the message but never replied. In school he would act normal but I still felt extremely uncomfortable around him and ashamed, so I just avoided him and blocked him on everything.. I just didn‚Äôt know what to do.. 

I also had a guy friend who made me cuddle with him once and it just made me feel so violated, like I didn‚Äôt have any control or say over what I wanted. It especially hurt because I thought he was one of my good friends, but the way he did it is he made it seem like it was a very normal thing for friends to do and that I was the one being the weirdo and asshole. So I just laid there on the couch for I don‚Äôt know how long just wanting it to be over. Thank god it only happened once and he never asked to do it again. 

Maybe my suicidal thoughts come from me never feeling like I have control over anything. I‚Äôm just tired of people thinking they can do what they want with me and treating me like I‚Äôm less of a human being than them, like I‚Äôm less deserving of respect. Especially as a very average-below average looking woman, I feel so invisible. I‚Äôm the most average looking woman you can imagine. Average height, weight, brown hair, brown eyes, my body is so bland and shapeless, and my boobs are barely a B cup. I don‚Äôt even feel like I have a good personality to make up for it. The only men who are ever into me are older men or creepy/controlling men. Sure I can do my best to put on a bunch of makeup, wear tighter more revealing clothing, get plastic surgery, but I feel like that would only attract worse men. 

I just wish that I could have a normal healthy mind. I wish that I could stop having these horrible thoughts about myself and truly love myself. I wish that I knew how to attract good men and maintain a healthy relationship with them. If you were to ask me to choose between a million dollars or love, I would choose love. I‚Äôm not even a picky person, sure we all have preferences that are just ingrained in us, I have mine. But again, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm asking for a lot. I‚Äôm pretty short and small, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm asking for a 6ft+ greek god. Just a guy with a sweet face and a kind, genuine personality, who will treat me right. I just want someone I can feel safe and comfortable with.

But I feel that I need to fix my mindset before I consider getting involved with someone. The last thing I would want is to finally find the perfect person only to taint them with my negativity... But I‚Äôve been trying for years and still nothing. I‚Äôve tried therapy but that was no help at all. I just feel like at this point it‚Äôs just better for me to stay away from everyone and to just let myself rot away into the dark. I‚Äôve lost hope and I‚Äôm just waiting for the right place and time to end it. I‚Äôve never really liked it here in America, so I‚Äôve even considered going somewhere in Europe, digging a hole in the ground in the woods somewhere, taking a bunch of pills, slitting my wrists, and just slowly drift away into the night. The last thing I want to see are the trees and stars.

Edit: sorry if my post is everywhere, but basically what I‚Äôm trying to say is I desperately want love but I feel like I am undeserving of it. But then on the other hand I‚Äôm also afraid of getting into a relationship because I‚Äôm afraid of being abused, abandoned, or cheated on. My parents had a bad relationship, both grandparents are divorced, and my aunt and baby cousin were murdered by her ex a couple years ago. I am still shaken by all of the things that have happened in life to the point were I have developed almost an actual fear of people, especially men. I‚Äôm constantly paranoid and feel like everyone is just out to take advantage of me and hurt me. I‚Äôm tired of living like this. I don‚Äôt want to be alone but I don‚Äôt have any other choice."

2291,depression,help,"I‚Äôve done a few really really horrible things in my past. Like objectively horrible. I can‚Äôt forgive myself for them, nor do I deserve forgiveness or pity. There‚Äôs no good justification for what I did. I feel like a hypocrite because people think I‚Äôm a good, sweet person, but I have these past actions that haunt me. I don‚Äôt deserve good things in life. My empathy has developed since then though, so I do truly regret what I did as a teenager. I would give everything to undo those things. I‚Äôve gone through some minor abuse/neglect and sexual trauma and some physical health problems, so maybe that was my karma for being a horrible person before?? Maybe the world tried to balance out the wrong that I did?? Where I‚Äôm really torn is I want to commit suicide so badly because I can‚Äôt live with what I did. But I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôd be an even worse person for doing that because my mom would be crushed. I deserve to suffer for what I did, but I also want to kill myself. Should I just call it even with the world since I went through trauma after/while causing harm and try to move on with my life and do better in the future? Is it better for me to suffer and stay around for my mom, or to just leave the world and end my suffering and make sure I never do anything bad again by being gone? Idk if making my mom so upset by committing suicide would be forgivable."
2292,depression,How do yall get by,"I have GAD, MDD and ADD and I have no escape without self medicating and currently have no meds for my depression or anything, So I really need advice on what people do to release or decompress after the day of torture, what do you guys do, or what dont you do.

2293,depression,Can someone give me their opinion,"I‚Äôve had depression for a while and in the past year or few years it started to get really bad. I can‚Äôt handle it. My main point my mood changes multiple times in one day now, before ide be fine or just down then have one day that I want to kill myself and hate myself and it‚Äôs so painful I dont know how to explain. Now it‚Äôs just randomly during the day, I‚Äôll be trying to make the day better and I just change to feeling worthless and like I‚Äôm ready to leave this life. Does this happen to anyone or does this mean it‚Äôs getting better or worse or something else? I‚Äôve been on Zoloft for almost 5 months now and am currently taking 100mg.

2294,depression,I impulsively posted of how i wanted to hurt myself and die on my instagram fan account,"What is wrong with me???? Why does this feeling come over me and try to murder my soul? Im so maniplatived. I have nothing going from my real life so im obsessed with my social media. I kind of hoped one of my online friends would ask if im okay and its fucking disgusting how toxic and mentally unstable and fucking deranged i am. Not only is my brain fucked up, so is my life and everyone and everything around me.
I will die alone. No one will ever fall in love with me and form a connection with me because i am utterly worthless"
2295,depression,I hate how much I need people's approval,"I hate how much I care about what other people think. I can rationally deduce that it is impossible to be liked by everyone, but my brain doesn't care! There must be something wrong with me, there HAS to! It's ridiculous how much I depend on the approval of others! I hate it. Whenever someone teases me or laughs at one little thing about me, I feel compelled to defend myself so they stop thinking lesser of me or try to change that part about myself. I can't just let stuff roll off my back. I've tried so hard not to care about what other people think, but I can't! How do normal people do it!? How!? The worst part is, my whole family is completely opposite. That's why there has to be something wrong with me. Why am I like this!?"

2301,depression,Mind plague- Noose obsessions. Drug lust. Pain enjoyment. Hopeless and worthless. What is the point.,My biggest fears. My darkest secrets. My dreams and goals. My addiction. My self harm. My inability to eat. What I've done. What I continue to do. The consequences. I'm scared. I'm anxious. I'm truely alone. Even if people say they're here for me they still aren't. They can't be. I won't tell them. I cant tell them. The deepest things inside of me are so dark. I am going to lose my mind. If I don't get a better therapist soon it's only a matter of time before I snap. My current one is shit and she also sees my brother so I can not continue to see her. Fuck that. This is what plagues me constantly everyday. Even in my dreams it doesn't go away. There is no escape. The only escape is death. This is what is on my mind. I need to get it out or it will kill me.

I dont understand and sometimes i think my feelings are just typical teenage angst. theres no reason for me to want to die but I still do. I feel so selfish."
2303,depression,I think I might hate my birthday,"So today is my birthday and I really have not been looking forward to it. Reason being is I don't really feel like I want to live right now it almost feels like I'm just not worth it. Most nights I cry myself to sleep thinking of the failure that I am at school and how small the chances are of me making it into college or even scoring a decent job. I believe everyone has a dream job but the worst part is making the realization that no matter how long you have wanted to be something it doesn't happen. I really hate my birthday because it reminds me that I have been living this life for another year. I don't exactly want to kill myself I just want to let everyone else enjoy their lifes without worrying about me. I was bullied for a long time and the people I thought were friends of mine ended up just being lies. I hate how some people say being bullied was the best thing that happened to them and that they lost alot of weight because of it. If you feel like being bullied was a good thing then you haven't been bullied. Every time I talk to someone I get scared, I start shaking and I've lost the ability to trust new people. Being bullied isn't good it really isn't. (I'm sorry If I got off topic I just had a lot of things to say and didn't quite know how to express myself. I don't know if somone else has experienced this but if you have then I am sorry. I also know a lot of people have it worse than me so I would like to tell all of you that you have put up a great fight against whatever is troubling you and I really hope things can get better for you.)"
2304,depression,I don't think I have any friends left to talk to,I find myself circling the drain. All the ones I trusted have shown some sort of bias that prevents me from opening up anymore. I feel so alone.
2305,depression,I just don‚Äôt like myself,"This is the central theme. I‚Äôm boring, awkward, fat, and not as kind as I could be. I‚Äôm also lazy and not very good at my job. I can‚Äôt seem to change and my life is more than half over."
2306,depression,No energy left at all,"I can‚Äôt maintain any of my relationships now. Even checking my notifications makes me feel exhausted. I have unread messages from the few people who reached out but I just can‚Äôt bring myself to answer them. I don‚Äôt even have a valid reason for why I‚Äôve been ghosting them, I just feel like I‚Äôm going to pass out whenever I wanna reply to someone. Since all of my friendships are online now due to COVID, this has helped make me completely stranded. Just stuck in the house with two family members who Im slowly getting extremely tired of, even though they‚Äôve done nothing wrong, I just can‚Äôt stand anything anymore. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel so trapped in a cage partially of my own creation."

2308,depression,I can't fucking do it,"This has been the hardest week in a really long time.  Intrusive thoughts are creeping in.  I've thought about killing myself every single day this week.  Ive been getting a day off from work every week for the past month for unrelated reasons and this week I thought I was going to finally make it through without taking a day off but my fucking brain won't let me.  Im calling in.  I'm exhausted, I feel like shit about myself and I'm fucking scared."
2309,depression,Depression and beyond,"I am 25 years old and unemployed. I cleared my engineering just about 2 weeks back thanks to the pandemic, after failing 4 subjects for 2 years.  
I used to drink about 2 full bottles of hard liquor a day back in 2019. I switched to smoking ganja after that. This month i abused about a 1000 pills of xanax. I have been depressed since forever.  
I was mentally and physically abused as a child until high school. I am severely depressed at this point. The xanax abuse has killed all my inhibitions. I can put a victorinox knife to my carotid without thinking twice. I have completely lost it, I am not interested in anything at all. I'm sick of media, games, shows, movies, literally everything. I tried suiciding back in 2012 by way of spraying bug spray down my throat, hoping it would condense and cause cardiac arrest because i had a technical faliure in my IB diploma high school (worst course one can opt for).   
My parents don't talk to each other and i dont talk to them. We live in the same house in different rooms, almost like a guest house to sleep in.  
I am extremely depressed and i am seriously considering taking 8-10mg of Xan and slitting my both my carotids.  
I workout...got a 2 pack etc, everyone loves me...there's no party without me. But i'm totally dead on the inside.  
Some asshole therapist suggested me to use Nexito...it had zero to none effect on my condition (my dick didnt work properly for a week or so), so that's the best result i could get.  
I have gone through a lot of spiritual revelations about life, the universe in general.  I feel we're living on a horrible planet. And i want to leave this world.   
I dont feel like eating, I don't want to meet people.And i have this major compulsion to fuck any woman i see. I have completely fried my brain. I seriously don't want to live at all  
Bottomline my life is a living hell. I have 20 bucks with me and i've been sitting at home since 9 months due to this pandemic. I have completely lost it. Suicide may not be the best option but i wont hesitate even for a second if it comes to that. I really need some honest advice."
2310,depression,Just Whining About Shit,"I'll never fix my problems. Every time I try I fail. I'm also full of shit, and yet most of the time I think I'm so smart. I'm really uneducated for my level of intelligence. I'm confused about everything and I don't know what to belief. My life won't change for the better and it's all downhill. Suicide sounds so fucking nice sometimes. Well, not nice really, just an end to pointless suffering and confusion.

Thanks for reading my useless ramble."
2311,depression,Depressed about the future,"I think I‚Äôm slowly falling into a deep depression about the future of the world. The thing that triggered it was the US elections. Seeing how many people voted for Trump after what he has done really saddened me, before that I was hopeful about how the pandemic showed how some of the idiotic world leaders (like in the US, Brazil, Mexico) were incompetent and they would be voted out. Now I think 24/7 about how many people are starving, how many animals are abandoned and suffering from industrial farms, how many people care more about partying than taking care of others in the community, how many kids are not receiving a proper education because of what‚Äôs going on and also how even though I‚Äôd love to have kids I wouldn‚Äôt do it because they wouldn‚Äôt have a future in this world (climate wise). I also feel guilt because I know I‚Äôm privileged and I don‚Äôt have to worry about what I‚Äôm going to eat or where I‚Äôm going to sleep. I just feel hopeless about everything and I don‚Äôt know how to explain that to others."
2312,depression,Im not lazy....,"I just cant hold anymore... i spent all my energy just to get up from my bed, or fake a smile while i cry all day, everyday 

So, stop to call me lazy, im doing way more than my body can hold, so just stop...."
2313,depression,I just had a mental breakdown at 12 in the morning,I‚Äôm still covered in tears.  I‚Äôm in a pit of worthlessness and anger.  I just want to be a normal person.  I don‚Äôt want this depression anymore. It seems pathetic for a 16 year old to cry their eyes out over something that isn‚Äôt real.  I‚Äôm rambling I‚Äôm sorry.

2315,depression,OD abuse,"For the past two months i have been abusing Xanax like there is no tomorrow. I have had severe depression since 2018. I am 25 and currently unemployed. I am losing my mind. I downed 30 mg of benzos in 1 single session last week. I have lost all inhibitions due to the Xan abuse. At this point i am majorly depresed and i wouldn't hesitate for a second  to put an ice pick to my carotid and slash it open.   
I want to know what the withdrawal symptoms will be and how am i going to feel once i stop taking this. And i also want to know how i can get over depression without these meds"
2316,depression,Feelings suck,"I simply cannot hold a stable relationship with anyone because of my nihilistic ways. No one gets it, no one understands, my mother told me I'd basically never find love and it just breaks me inside. Maybe I am destined to be alone after all. I don't know why I expect anything from anyone anymore. Whenever I meet someone new I make up a perfected version of them in my head, and then get sad when they're not how I envisioned them to be. I know this is wrong, and no matter how hard I try to tell myself that no one is 100% of what you want them to be, I always continue this cycle of meeting someone new and then ending whatever we had months after. It's all just so pointless, I don't know why I try anymore. It's just so hard to breakaway from the fantasies because you want that person so fucking much. On top of this, I have a series of mental issues such as schizophrenia that make it hard for a potential love interest to accept me for who I truly am. No one wants a project, and I'm a hard one at that. I guess I'm just a lost cause at this point. I wish all my struggles would go away so I can be normal and live a normal life. But instead I am trapped by this darkness that consumes my mind and every fibre of my being. It must be nice to love and to be loved, something which I'll never have, so I live through others in hopes to feel the fucking same."
2317,depression,I can't take this anymore,"I've been diagnosed with depression for 5 years now, had my ups and downs since there and i discovered that I've been living whith it for a long time, but I've never been so low in my state. I've been dating for four years and my gf have depression too so I never really wanted to put weight on her because of me and always help her and thank God I could do that, now she's a better person that can laugh and enjoy a lot of things. 
On the other hand, even trying so hard to never put this weight on her i had a serious breakdown that I've never had in front of her, and she reacted saying good things for me on the moment, but since then she stopped being the same until today...she simply exploded whith me saying that I am doing this on purpose and trying to get people to be pity about me and that she can't take this because I'm a burden and she don't owes me anything. I agree with her, she don't but she was the last person I had that I could trust and ask for some help and now for her it looks like that im better dead than anything and I just can't keep holding up...she was my last fortress and the one I had to count on this times but after the horrible things she said I just can't...I'm weak and have no one anymore...I'm tired from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep and even hurt myself and I gotta say that even with this direct contact I can fell anything anymore. I just wanna go you know, I have literally nothing left and I'm tired of just being a burden to everyone 
Sorry to take your time if you read through, really"
2318,depression,It‚Äôs not really fair that people force you to live..,"I didn‚Äôt ask to be born and I didn‚Äôt ask for this sh!t life so why is it fair that people (the government, hospitals, police officers, even family and friends) force you to keep living when it‚Äôs literally torture every single day. Every time I‚Äôve ever contemplated.. I‚Äôve stopped myself and realized how bad it would hurt my family but then I get angry because why do they want me to suffer? Why don‚Äôt they want me to be at peace? When old or chronically ill people die everyone says, ‚Äúwell at least they are no longer suffering.‚Äù Why not want that for me?"
2319,depression,I got told I wasn‚Äôt sick and was honestly a little disappointed,"A while back I had covid and had to be hospitalized which included lots of blood work. After being discharged I got a call that some things in my blood work looked off and I‚Äôd have to see a doctor at their cancer center.
I feel so guilty that I felt some relief (?) I pretty much instantly accepted the fact I may have had cancer and was ready to die.


So the day comes and I go to my appointment. They also handle blood disorders in the cancer center apparently. So the doctor basically just told me I was called in to them because something in my blood suggested a predisposition to clotting and was possibly (though not likely) genetic. Wow. 


I left the appointment a little disappointed and I know that makes me a horrible person. My dad was relieved, I‚Äôm sure because he didn‚Äôt want to deal with the cost of cancer treatments, and I know he loves me but his love has limits. For example, he doesn‚Äôt love me enough to take me seriously when I say I‚Äôm depressed, anxious, suicidal and need help. 


I know I‚Äôm technically a ‚Äúgrown woman‚Äù I‚Äôm an adult but I‚Äôm on his insurance plan and I‚Äôm not too keen on giving up good insurance just to be independent when I have other chronic physical health conditions. I can already barely take care of myself. I don‚Äôt make enough to even pay a therapist on a sliding scale and the last time I went to one who said she was willing to go pro bono she dropped me in two sessions. Apparently she could already tell I‚Äôd be too stubborn/ a waste of time and too difficult. Little did she know that was the first time I had actually stayed committed to my meds (6 months, never skipped a dose) and didn‚Äôt cancel/rescheduled a million times. I had been proud of myself for once; I was so excited to tell her how proud I was and I didn‚Äôt even get to tell her before it all just fell apart so quick.


I‚Äôve been in a dark place the past few weeks but especially today and idk what to do. I‚Äôm just exhausted and really guilty that for a while I had been hoping to get diagnosed with a terminal illness."

2321,depression,Life always has a twist,"Whenever something is going my way, just when I start to think wow things aren‚Äôt so bad, life fucks me. It‚Äôs just a cycle of ups and downs. I‚Äôm afraid to get excited about things anymore or get my hopes up because I just expect to be let down. I guess this is the way life naturally progresses. I feel like I‚Äôm consistently doing what I need to do to be moving in the right direction but it feels like it doesn‚Äôt matter. Shit just keeps getting worse. I feel like total shit today but I know I‚Äôll feel ok tomorrow and maybe even good the next day. But then the cycles repeats and I feel like shit. I‚Äôm just trying to keep moving in the right direction but it just feels unrewarding and pointless."
2322,depression,I've been feeling so fucking bad today. I felt like throwing up earlier.,"I've calmed down a little bit but I still feel like crap. I keep having suicidal thoughts.

For the first time in my life, I am alone. I have no friends anymore. I still at 19 haven't had a girlfriend. The last friend I had started icing me.

I don't really know what to do. I try my best to be happy and supportive online but I've been pretty snarky lately because I'm giving up. I just don't have any energy left.

I don't want to be alone yet I force myself to be alone by being too fucking afraid to find a job or get out more.

I haven't dated because I'm too fucking scared of nothing. I've had chances, never took them.

I know I'm obviously a decent looking person as I've had decent looking girls be interested in me but I just can't let people into my heart, it's too fucking scary. I don't want to be called over emotional because my emotion is all I have. I am nothing but an emotional wreck half the time, and I'm starting to fall apart at the seams.

People don't notice but I'm not okay. I've tried to push through my depression, understand it, accept it for what it is... I can't do it.

I just feel like I don't have the energy to better my life, yet I need to better my life to find the energy I need.

I feel really alone for the first time in my life. I feel truly afraid for the first time in my life.

All I can think of is, ""I wanna go home"" even though I'm in my own house. This place doesn't feel like home anymore it feels almost like a prison. I have no one to talk to but family and reddit.

I don't know what to do."

Sometimes, like right now, I feel the need to hurt me, to punish my body for not being good enough (yes I‚Äôm talking about self cutting) I feel like I really need other‚Äôs approval, specially approval from the opposite sex. I could never admit this to my friends or relatives since I feel pathetic for even having those thoughts. My own embarrassment doesn‚Äôt even let me seek for help, but I don‚Äôt want to live anymore.

2335,depression,Whats the next step?,"Hey guys

Ive been feeling lost for a while now. Like I'm just coasting, just waiting for the day to be done. Im 20 years old, thirs year of college, and I have no idea who I am anymore. Back in high school i was pushed to be great. Everyone vouched for me, I had to be great at school, I had to be a great role model, i had to go to university to become a teacher... Now I don't even want to finish school. Ive been going through some shit. I got big body issues. I lost one of my bestfriends recently and I don't know why. I think i have an eating disorder. I don't feel happy. The only time I feel happy is when I get high. It comes to a point where Im always high. 

I had an appointment with my family doctor and i got a referal for a psychologist. Im on a waitlist right now, but it could be months. I feel suicidal most of my day. its not like I would end my life, but these thoughts are always present and it makes it hard to enjoy little things when you hate your body and brain. 

All i want to do right now is drugs. Is that bad to say? Ive tripped a couple times and I smoke weed all the time, but sometimes its just not enough. I know that i shouldnt fuck with strong shit. Ive seen people on hard drugs and Im scared of them. But at the same time, it would be nice to not worry about shit.

I act like Im fine, but im dying inside. I keep my head up for my friends, because ive always been like that. My friend circle got fucked with when one of my bestfriends blocked me a couple weeks ago. I try to be over it yknow, but all the memories keep flooding my mind and all the promises, all the ""we in the forever"" or the ""youre important to me"" haunt me right now. My other friends keep saying he's gonna come around. Honestly I don't think so because of his ego. I wish he could come back because I love him and care so much about him, but how am I supposed to trust him again? How am I supposed to put all this pain behind and act like it never existed? I wish someone could talk to him, like call him out for his behaviour because everyone knows he's not doing okay but no one is helping. I want to help, but Im the only person who cant. I wish someone could tell him to wake the fuck up. I dont care if he doesnt want to be friends anymore, i just want to know why. To get some closure? To see if its me who's broken? I don't know. All i know is that it hurts.

Im lonely. I feel so lonely, yet i hang out with friends everyday. I think im not ready for love. I think that i might not meant to be loved. 

So whats the next step? How do I get out of this hell? Knowing that I dont want to stop doing drugs, I cant leave school because im already 30k$ in debt. What do I do to become happy again?

thanks."
2336,depression,"I‚Äôve been suicidal since I‚Äôm 11. I‚Äôm 18 now, and I feel like I have actually tried everything. I‚Äôm not afraid anymore.","I wrote and planned my first suicide when I was 11. I was sexually assaulted when I was 12. I had a string of toxic and abusive boyfriends until I was 17. Bullied by everyone and subsequently was made everyone‚Äôs worst enemy in high school. My parents love me to death, but I know for a fact I‚Äôm a burden. Accomplished everything I was supposed to do in high school in order to make me me happy‚Äîvaledictorian, president of everything, multiple merit based scholarships, multiple team captains‚Äîand still attempted twice because of course nothing attainable would make someone genuinely happy. Had a spiritual awakening. Grew a lot and learned to reprogram my subconscious. Broke out of the metaphorical matrix. Had a hope for a little bit, but I am done. Death doesn‚Äôt scare me anymore, especially with the philosophy of life that I have now with spirituality, philosophy, and omnism. The only thing that has kept me here is guilt for the subsequent pain I would pass along to my friends and family. My mother and boyfriend especially. My boyfriend loves me the most in the entire world, and I‚Äôm so unbelievably lucky, but I‚Äôve been in pain for a long time. I‚Äôve lost 2 people I‚Äôve cared about to suicide and I‚Äôve seen all the people they were close to recover. I know it will hurt my loved ones for a while, but I know they‚Äôll get better especially with each other. I‚Äôve been so intensely suicidal for so long that my friends don‚Äôt even get alarmed when I self harm or cry about it anymore. It‚Äôs that normalized. They expect it of me. I understand how exhausting it is to be so present for someone like that so of course I don‚Äôt mind. I think I am including to add emphasis on how severely suicidal I‚Äôve been. I go to therapy and that helped. I do a lot of CBT and shadow work to improve my mental health, and im very self aware regarding psychology and my ego, but now it‚Äôs just awareness because my circumstances are too strenuous to allow me to employ and practice what I know. Been stretched thin for a long time. 

I want to pass around my birthday. It‚Äôs February 13th so it‚Äôs after the holiday season. That way, my death won‚Äôt be associated with the holidays. I‚Äôm Vietnamese so I‚Äôm concerned about Lunar New Year and valentines but that‚Äôs all. I‚Äôve been saving money for a long time because I have generalized anxiety with an emphasis on money and disasters, so I have a lot saved for my funeral. I don‚Äôt think it makes me sad, like planning this, or the fact that I have a plan in general. This is so privileged and redundant and annoying, so I‚Äôm sorry. I think I just needed an outlet because I don‚Äôt want to burden my friends and my boyfriend anymore. At least here people have the option to scroll past, which I respect and somewhat endorse(?) Because I think my mind is made. 

I think I‚Äôm going to take things with work and school down a notch so I have the room to indulge in a few things I‚Äôve always wanted to do before I die. Going to check back into real life now because I have finals :/ Sending love to anyone else who needs it."
2337,depression,What's next,"Ibe just finished a 3 year relationship with the women i thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with. I was a social recluse before with a suicidal mindset and had a dedicated plan to end my life as I am sick to death of the place and I hate it. Throughout those 3 years I gained a different point of view and decided to stay around as I was happy and realised the damage I would cause my relatives if I did something like that.

My question is hiw do I stop slipping into the mindset that I was in before I met my ex. Has anyone on here experienced anything similar and what did you do if you have.

I'm just scared of being sad for the rest of my life I don't want to be like this it's pissing me off. I can't find any hobbies or any other reason to be here other than not wanting to hurt my family. I'm fed up and sick of it all"

2339,depression,Girlfriend with depression,"Hey all, I'm here trying to learn a bit more about how depression affects people. For context, my girlfriend has depression. We've been dating for almost a year. It's been really, really hard. We did about three months long distance, but pretty much all of it feels like long distance because of the pandemic. She lives with her parents who are both 65+ so she was reluctant to hang out with me indoors from march til we went LD in the summer. I thought when we got back it would be better; I was moving into a new place so I could isolate myself more completely, but the renovation went until about a month ago. Then we had our first spat and she's been super depressed since.

I knew she had depression but this is the worst ive seen it affect her. I'm trying to be supportive because I know it isn't anything she's doing on purpose, but I just don't fully understand how ot affects her. We haven't been talking much, just a few banal texts every few days. I want to more completely understand how she feels but she says she just doesn't have the energy for such an emotional conversation right now. I haven't seen her in like two months and have barely spoken to her for one and miss her like crazy. I'm just hoping there's someone here who can tell me a little bit more about what you feel like and what's going through your head when you can't get out of bed and can barely talk to the people you love.

I've been doing a pretty good job taking care of myself through this. I still eat as much as I should and have been talking to a counselor myself which has helped. I'm really just here to try and hear from some folks who have been through it. Anyone who has a depressed partner and wants to talk about it is welcome as well. Thanks all."

I never got compliments on my appearance or told that I was attractive by anyone except family who obviously are only going to say that because they‚Äôre family, and at this point I just ignore their comments about being handsome because I don‚Äôt even believe them anymore, I think they‚Äôre just trying to make me feel better. 

After a terrible relationship with a girl that ended almost 2 years ago, I haven‚Äôt been out with any girls and have only actually been seriously interested in one, only one girl in that whole time that I‚Äôve been actually interested in. I work with her, and while we have so much in common, including morals and dating ‚Äúrules‚Äù, and have had managers make comments like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be a really cute couple‚Äù and the like, I know that deep down she doesn‚Äôt feel the same and it kills me. I feel like the only thing stopping her from wanting me is that I‚Äôm ugly and that‚Äôs not something I can fix. 

I‚Äôm frustrated because I‚Äôm very smart and talented and the people close to me know this, but no amount of intelligence or musical ability is going to make someone say ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs cute.‚Äù,  only looks will. I feel like if someone just took the time to get to know me they would look past my physical imperfections. 

Which leads me to my next point, if someone who I feel is so right for me doesn‚Äôt want me, how am I even going to attract anyone else, right or wrong? I feel like I was born to suffer in this life and just watch everyone else be happy and do the things I want to do but am always prevented from by circumstances beyond my control.

One of the mentions went to a story that got a third as many likes as mine.
From there, I just plummeted. I put my mind to something, I did the absolute best I could, and it was all for nothing. I'm not even good at something I enjoy. I've never won at any kind of competition, no matter how hard I try. I'm forced to face the fact that I don't actually have any talents. My therapist tried to help, but he doesn't understand that, to me, the fun of making the story in the first place is just a crappy participation trophy.

2355,depression,Finding comfort in fictional characters,"Hi there!
This is my first post on reddit! Please let me know if I've broken any rules or made a mistake somehow - I'm new to this and happy to learn the ropes. 

I've been struggling with chronic, treatment-resistant depression for about 4 years now. I lot of my experience has to do with university and the difficulties of studying a degree I'm not interested in - happy to elaborate if people want to know. 

Anyway, as a teenager I was really into novels - I finished the hunger games in a week of school holidays after picking up the first book. I read pretty much every YA series there was a few years back.
Whenever there was conflict around me I managed to escape into the world of a book for a little while and it was a wonderful coping mechanism/outlet.

Over the course of the last few years I've stopped being able to read. I started to struggle with concentrating on the words, and books didn't play like a movie in my head anymore like they used to. After a couple of genuine efforts to get back into it I kind of just gave up.

Then this year during lockdown I bought myself a Kobo Forma (like a kindle but a different brand) and picked up a digital copy of Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson after a friend got herself a Kindle. Somehow something just clicked and I devoured three books over the course of two weeks.

Long story short, I'm halfway through the latest book of Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive series and I wanted to post about the writing of Kaladin Stormblessed.

It's the first series I've ever read where the main character (Kaladin) has, and engages with, depression. For me, his experiences in the book really hit home on points like giving up, distancing yourself from others, hopelessness etc. 
Just reading through his story made me feel like there are other people in the world who genuinely understand what I'm going through. I almost feel like I have a friend who just gets it. 
I almost feel like I have something to hang on to when I'm struggling, like ""oh but Kaladin also goes through this so maybe I'm not being stupid/lazy/insane/irrational..."" 
It has been incredibly validating. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience with this series, or any other books? I'm interested to hear whether this is something that helps other people as well and if there are other really well-written characters in other books/TV shows/movies etc. That specifically deal with the lived experience of depression.


Tl/Dr : The writing of Kaladin in the Stormlight Archive book series made me feel less alone. Has anyone else has a similar experience?"
2356,depression,Tired of everything,"I‚Äôm Asian, ugly, 20F, social anxiety, lost 2 jobs to COVID, sexually abused when I was 5 by female teen neighbor then 3 years later by an old male distant relative, bullied in 8th grade by my teacher‚Äôs assistant(gossips to other teachers about me that I was a horrible student even though I‚Äôm not), doesn‚Äôt go to college, went through a breakup, cousin‚Äôs mom hates me and my family because we‚Äôre poor and she‚Äôs wealthy already, and I‚Äôve been depressed since I was 5.

I don‚Äôt want them to be sad. But just being alive is hell to me. I cry myself to sleep every night saying to myself that I wish I was never born. I also dreamt of ways on how to kill myself. I just do nothing and stay at home in my bed all day wasting my life and slowly rotting inside. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I want to sleep forever. I‚Äôm tired...I‚Äôm tired...I‚Äôm tired."
2357,depression,Emotionally Detached From The World,"I can't really remember the last time in my life that I have been genuinely happy and don't see it forthcoming in my future. I always feel like I'm just moving through the motions of life with no real significance or meaning. I can't properly form relationships with people because I feel like I can never be myself unapologetically or confidently - which probably stems from my childhood. Furthermore, people can't understand my complexity and just label me as friendly, but mysterious. I grew up as an INFJ and turned into an INTJ as time progressed if that helps some of you.

Growing up, I was the youngest sibling and was pretty used to taking crap from my older sister and brother. However, I was also a little chunky since about 6 years old which made me an easy target for my parents to constantly belittle me and fat-shame me - even now (I'm 22). They always made slick comments and made harsh remarks towards my weight. Because of this I've always had serious body image issues, but never the motivation to change it. I was never bullied at school because I was the type of kid that was friends with everyone and could fit into any group, but that's because my bullies were at home. They continued to disregard my feelings and as I grew older the once vibrant/lively little boy I used to be grew colder as the years passed. 

Sports was a big cornerstone in my household considering that my siblings and I have all played baseball/softball since around the age of 3 (Neither parent did). I was a perfectionist and started disliking baseball once I got to high school and completely lost a passion to play my freshman year. Although I made really good grades and was even in the honors class, my parents were extremely pissed at me when I stopped showing up to practice and even tried to force me to continue playing. My parents instantly began insinuating that I was gay because I quit sports (little did they know I had been a closeted bisexual for a year already). I even offered to uptake other individual sports that allowed me to hone in on my perfectionism like track &amp; field, cross country and powerlifting, but they simply were too pissed to allow me to do so. I was super involved in leadership around campus but that wasn't even enough. My father didn't talk to me for 3 weeks before he told me that I was a piss poor excuse for a son and my mother would never advocate for me so she stayed silent. A few months later, they sent my sister to look through my phone in the middle of the night while I was sleeping when she came across a text convo with another girl in which I confessed that I thought I may be bisexual. My sister woke me up at 2 AM and proceeded to call me a fag and ran and showed my parents. My parents were crying and pissed trying to have a conversation with me in which I kept denying my sexuality and denying that I even sent that message. My entire family is very homophobic although they try to preach that they are progressive, ""accepting"" people.

Having all of this (and more) happen at such a young age, I never had an emotional relationship with anybody and I am very emotionally detached from everybody and everything. I've aways been the happy kid with a good head on his shoulders, but nobody ever saw the depth of darkness that surrounded me and still does. I fell into a deep depression in my junior year of college and never really recovered. I no longer have a desire to be friends with people I have known my whole life because I see myself as so much more open-minded and accepting than them. Now, I'm a 22 year old PhD student (still closeted) who is very emotionally numb, comfortable with death and doesn't believe in permanent happiness for myself. I avoid everybody any chance I get and get very miserable in the company of family and friends.

The only time I feel happy for an extended period of time is when I'm under the influence. Kinda wish I never resorted to drinking but I stop feeling shitty.

I gave a bullshit answer and he just went quiet and we never spoke abt it again. The thing is, I really want help. My family is rlly strict abt mental health and when my doctor proposed therapy for one of the conditions, my dad was immediately against it. Another example is when I cried at school because I had bottled everything up, my grandma told me I was a disgrace and that I was crazy and my dad told me I was the reason he hated existing.

2371,depression,I‚Äôm cracking up,"Unwanted thoughts often suffocate me, but I‚Äôve always been able to hide everything I feel in the inside, fake a laugh and simply ignore the whispers in my head telling me to kill myself.

But over the past few years, the rain pouring inside of me started to slowly form an ocean and all I can do is helplessly stare at it as it swallows me alive. 

I have reached my limits.. I became so fragile that sometimes the comfort brought by taking a deep breath is enough to make me cry. I can‚Äôt control myself anymore.. I can‚Äôt hide, conceal, or fake anything. I feel like I‚Äôm always on the verge of crying and I keep having panic and anxiety attacks in public, mostly at school. 
I awfully broke down in front of my family once, It happened suddenly, my whole body was shaking and I couldn‚Äôt stop crying. My mother made fun of me after that and I felt embarrassed to the core.. I still feel ashamed for not being able to hold my feelings in that day.

I‚Äôm crumbling down. The walls I spent my whole life building are all falling down. My heart is beating outside my chest, and I can feel people‚Äôs stares piercing through it. I‚Äôm shattered now. My insides are flooding, and it‚Äôs all spilling out.

There‚Äôs a voice inside my head that never shuts up, ‚Äú Do it.‚Äù it whispers, ‚Äú let it go, let it all go. Take a step, jump into the blue, free yourself from the task of living.‚Äù

2372,depression,Need advice and reassurance pls,"Hey all,
I (19,F) have recently been to an ER specialised in mental health. I've explained them that my depression has progressively worsen over the course of the last few weeks and that I didnt feel like I could make it through the next days.

I've also talked about the fact that my self harm was out of control and that I was having a suicide plan pretty established that consisted in defenestration (i live in the 6th floor)

They kept me one night, put me on Valium, and told me to leave. Wrote on the rapport that I was experimenting a mild episode, even though the team i saw the morning told it was severe.

I'm honnestly confused, and a little bit furious. I have the feeling that they didnt took me seriously, as given the fact that Im a young woman.

What does it takes to get proper help? Do I have to make a suicide attempt or be totaly psychotic to deserve help and get hospitalised?

Idk anymore."

A 22 year old shouldn't be constantly wallowing in self pity and instead be enjoying his youth.

A 22 year old shouldn't being doing 95% of all normal activities alone

A 22 year old shouldn't be saying ""No one knows I exist. If i dissapeared it would take a long time for anyone to notice""

It is very worrying looking back and realizing ""I spent my birthdays in college alone in my appartment, while everyone else spent it with their friends.""

I go to the gym and work on myself, but for what? Being depressed is still going to send me to an early grave and no one will notice.

I'm too boring to date. What girl would want to date an emotionally starved and unstable loner who spends 80% of his time alone?

There are people at work my age. They talk about seeing their friends, I can't really relate.

I just feel weird and different.  I hope to one day get famous on social media one day, because maybe people will notice I exist.

What I came to think about tonight is depression seems to stem from what we want ourselves to be. Cool, smart, funny, etc. what I came to think about today is.. if you don‚Äôt have it you don‚Äôt have it. We trick ourselves into thinking we are ok, but really it will never be ok - right?

I basically had relatively normal mental health with a bit of anxiety until I was about 11, it‚Äôs like my anxiety and depression suddenly started spiralling out of control and I stopped going to school  (My hair was literally falling out from stress) and because of this I‚Äôve never had any chance to make friends outside of my family, for the past 4-5 years all I‚Äôve been doing is sitting in my bedroom with my door closed and my curtains pulled wasting my life when I should be out doing things, my skin is literally the colour of paper because i haven‚Äôt had any sunlight for years and my anxiety is so bad I have extreme trouble even leaving my room even to get a glass of water or to go to the bathroom which is right down the hall.


My depression progressively got worse and worse from this and now I feel like it‚Äôs the worst I‚Äôve ever been in my life I‚Äôve suddenly developed extreme paranoia and distrust in pretty much everyone around me, I‚Äôve got no friends no goals and no hobbies, all I do is sit in my room and go on my phone all day trying to distract myself from anything productive that I should be doing going to sleep at 4am waking up at 12pm and repeating the same cycle, I basically have no education from all my problems with school and I have a really hard time trying to care about it at all, I‚Äôve had more therapists and psychiatrists that I can count and tried so many different medications and it‚Äôs like nothing works because I‚Äôm so stubborn and pessimistic, my anxiety had gotten to the point where I‚Äôm stuck in my room all day doing the same thing thinking everybody knows everything about me and if I force myself to get outside I instantly want to go home because I imagine everyone looking at me and laughing at me.

I feel like I‚Äôm wasting my entire life and all I can do is just watch myself, I feel like I‚Äôm existing instead of living I can‚Äôt even remember how it feels to be genuinely happy and stress free it‚Äôs like every time I try to get better a new problem comes along, i always think that I‚Äôll never be normal and have a normal life, I feel like a can relate to nobody because everyone I see with the same problems as me has at least a few friends but I have none and I don‚Äôt even know how to make them, I cant even talk to people online because it makes me so uncomfortable.

I feel like nothing I do is ever good enough and I feel like I‚Äôm the laziest person ever because I always have to fuck it all up for myself somehow , it‚Äôs like my brain refuses to do anything healthy and it‚Äôs just constantly on self sabotage mode, even trying to write about it like I‚Äôm doing right now just makes me roll my eyes at myself and want to just delete the whole thing because of how stupid I sound."

Ever since I got his diagnosis I have been extremely depressed. Usually my depression will come and go, but this has been a constant sadness I can't shake. I feel so hopeless. My relationship is so fragile right now, although I love my sons dad I dont have the energy to fight for this anymore. I'm failing at being a mother and wife. I work as a server and I'm ashamed everyday going to work because of how a lot of people talk and treat us waitresses. My job is very stressful and the managers just don't care. I'm burnt out after 5 years there, but I apply everywhere I can and never get a call back. I have 1 friend who I don't talk to often, and it's hard to make friends when I get so anxious around big groups and strangers. I could go on and on but who really cares?

I‚Äôm afraid that abortion will become illegal nationally. I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôll lose my life to COVID because of Trump‚Äôs negligence. Oh yeah, forgot to mention that I have a lung disorder (really hard to explain so I won‚Äôt) that puts me at a high risk of life threatening complications. My sister said that the person at the polling location she went to said ‚Äúif you aren‚Äôt voting for Trump then you have to select libertarian.‚Äù My sister voted straight libertarian because of an election judge fucking with the election. I am so scared.

All I‚Äôm asking for is a little decency and humanity from the world but I can‚Äôt get that. I‚Äôm not a Democrat and I‚Äôm CERTAINLY not a Republican. Personally, I don‚Äôt even think people that are support Trump are Republicans. They have created their own political party full of hatred.

I see them staring at me, I know they‚Äôre thinking about how I look, I know people in my life judge me and are embarrassed to be around me. None of this is even conspiracy, my father had literally told me he‚Äôs embarrassed to be seen with me. My husband and I rarely have sex anymore and when we do I dread it because I feel repulsive and like he‚Äôs only doing it because he has to. I can‚Äôt do normal people things like ride a plane, sit in a booth, go on rides, sit in movie theater seats and it genuinely makes me want to not exist. Not die necessarily because I‚Äôm absolutely terrified of death, but more like live completely alone. I can do whatever I want, eat whatever I want, and be whoever I want and never have a soul judge me. My agoraphobia has returned to the point where I spend weeks at a time in my house barely leaving even to go through fast food places or get gas.

2400,depression,My take on darkness. Maybe this will help some of you see the full side of the glass,"About darkness. What can I say except that I like it. There was a time when I was a kid and I didn't. Like most kids I would imagine that there are monsters hiding in the dark and oh boy it was a race from the bathroom to my bedroom at night after turning the bathroom lights off. 

That being said, I think that my fondness of darkness began one evening when I was with my mom (and some other people that I don't remember) and we went out at night to have a walk. I still see it clearly in my head, we were walking on the busiest street from my hometown, during the day that is, and I was just in awe; there wasn't a soul on that street except us and it gave me a feeling of peacefulness that I had never experienced before. Amazing.

After that night I was in love with it! Of course what I liked best about it was the lack of other people. I never liked the people in my hometown very much; there was not much diversity when it came to people there, I felt that most of them were stupid and superficial and the ones that were not, didn't stick for long or were just good at hiding. It also didn't help that it was not a big town at all, everyone knew everyone and to top it off, my mom was a postwoman which meant most of them knew her and subsequently me as well. I just couldn't move a finger without people gossiping, because that's what people that are stupid and superficial mostly do; I can't really blame them, what can you do when you have a narrowed thinking? Talk about other people as a form of entertaining. And what do you need most in a small town? A form of entertaining, right?

Anyway, like I said, I was in love with darkness and growing up it became more and more accessible; after all, you can't really go out at 2 AM when you are a kid, but when you become a teenager things start to change which brings me to my teenage years. I had a mildly fucked up childhood so I started doing what most people with fucked up childhoods do, experiment with substances. At first it was just drinking, another thing that I fell in love with. I mean, how could a child that had quite a few inhibitions not like getting drunk a.k.a. getting rid of those inhibitions. I started drinking with one close friend every Friday and by the time I graduated highschool it was a habit along with smoking weed. Now, you may wonder what does this have to do with darkness. Well, it all happened at night, mostly. Only then I could avoid all those thirsty for gossip eyes and ears. One more reason to like it. Not to mention that when morning came after a night of drinking and smoking weed, an overwhelming feeling always crept over me (and my friends for that matter) that the evening was over, it was time for everyone to go home and sleep. That made me hate mornings so much and it still happens to this day, 4 years after highschool. Fate would have it that I am writing this as a way to cope with one of those mornings; it's 7:50 AM and the light announced the end of a beautiful night. Too bad that I can't sleep.

Soon after high school I found another kind of darkness. This time it was not in the literal sense, this time it was a darkness of the mind. You know, sadness, anger, alienation, rejection, insecurities, fear et cetera, all the makings of good art and suicide thoughts (too bad I only experienced the latter). At first I didn't like this darkness, who would? For about two years, as this darkness grew, it crippled me more and more. Then I slowly began getting used to it, it still was this monster that followed me everywhere, but when something is constant, you just get used to it eventually, it becomes a part of you. And as I got used to it, I started seeing the other monsters out there, some bigger than mine, some smaller; it felt good knowing I'm not the only one. Soon after that, I also noticed the beauty that these monsters can create, you could say that I started to seeing the full side of the glass, not just the empty one. The thing that I am talking about is, as I mentioned earlier, art. There's a few things that I firmly believe in this life and one of them is that really good art can only come from darkness. So yeah, now I am kind of in love with this darkness too, although there are moments when the monster finds new tricks to play on me making me hate it again, the love still comes back. I just hope its imagination has limits and someday there are no more new tricks."

2402,depression,My goals when happy are too unrealistic and I don't know how to make them work,"But when depressed I have goals and they're a lot more realistic, I naturally plan out how i'm going to make them work, so does depression occur naturally when you see no way of achieving your goals?"
2403,depression,My friend keeps saying depression sounds relaxing no matter how much I try to explain,One of my friends just does not understand. I‚Äôve told him that my depression has made me lose interest in things but that I feel bored lying around doing nothing all day. He tells me every day oh you must be having fun just relaxing. It is frustrating like he thinks I‚Äôm lying about struggling. How can I explain this in a way he will understand?
2404,depression,Getting depressed about small things is really frustrating,"I'm desperate for a pet that I can hold and snuggle. I'm married and almost 30 yet I feel like a 12 year old trying to prove to my parent that I'm responsible enough to have a pet. 

I cant get my spouse on board and it's seriously getting me down. I'm mad at myself for not being able to let it go an move on, which depresses me even more. It all feels so major even though it's pretty insignificant in the big picture."

2406,depression,Isn't everything just so boring?,"I seem to lack interest in anything. I'm not as badly depressed as I used to be. I feel functional. Everything feels boring and pointless though. Sometimes I think of a job or something id like to do. I spend days looking into it. Then I just forget about it because I'm bored. Why would I want to invest in a future if ill always be bored. Everything I try to do makes me bored and in turn makes me sad. I just do things to get to the next day. I'm not looking forward to the next day, I would just like to sleep so that I dont feel bored."
2407,depression,A very shortened version why I rather wake up dead tomorrow,"idk if I can even form in words how much I hate my life. How much I go to bed not wanting to wake up in the morning, that's the dream right there, you die by something that isn't even your fault. You do nothing everyday but yet you still fall behind in school ruining the future if you did stay alive to get, and wanting to die at every given moment. I once had to stop myself from going downstairs because I had the urge to jump down the stairs but it wasn't because I wanted to stop myself from dying, it was because I know there was a likely chance I wouldnt die. You watch in a front row seat everything you once love slowly becoming terrible in your mind. How mostly everyone leaves you and the people that stay are doing it out of sympathy, effectively changing the entire friendship dynamic. You also watch as your room gets messy beyond belief because you dont have any motivation to clean it because you dont have motivation to live the next day. How you constantly have to put on a fake smile to try and trick your mind as if you're ok for just long enough to get through each task you are forced to go in. How you know nothing can make you happy and feel even more hopeless. But you feel and see all that constantly as you remind yourself taking the easy way out to end it all would traumatize people and it would be your fault, and only your fault"
2408,depression,Thoughts on medication(personal),"I don't like medication.

When I discovered that I had depression and anxiety all sort of stuff,I really wanted to fight it myself.

Medication?A way of tricking my mind, pathetic.

And after years,I had changed a lot,

I felt worst day after day,so as my health. Then desperate, suicidal.

This is an abyss.

Until...I don't remember,
I get myself into dark humour,
drive myself into another way rather than just being positive.
Finally,I developed my own thought pattern (sort of),
I see myself a tiny creature, competing for live.
This is REALITY,and people including me can die for real.
I need to be better than others to stay here.

I used my survival instinct‚Äîfight to help myself.

I thought I am on the right track,
but again another instinct emerged‚Äîflight.

I can't stop backing up.

Even worse,with a 'negative' signal from my brain and a slight panic attack,I relapsed, reset all my progress I made on being 'normal'.

I tried to manage it and minimize the effects it brings me.  However,when I reached a certain spot,I got stuck.

I can feel the limit my genes set up,as if as I try to trespass it,my nerves would be triggered and send me back to the place I was before.

Medication, maybe a solution to this,I can tell it can help me.

Although before I am an adult,I don't have access to it.

Guess I need to keep suffering for a while *chuckles*"

I squandered my entire social life as a child and teenager by being so fucking weird and sometimes creepy that I eventually I had to leave school and get homeschooled when I was 13. I got bullied a lot.

Theres 2 years till I leave my house and theres a million things I wish I'd done or got to do but I feel like I squandered any opportunity to make any friends, learn any hobbies that I wish I had, or just generally not be a social recluse with no social skills or academic skills.

I wish I could redo all of this and redo this pathetic attempt at life.

I wish I was born into better circumstances and a better area. I constantly fantasize about how my life would be better if I had been born elsewhere or how it would be better if I just was a better person for most of it.

2419,depression,My life is over,"\- I have been this way for most my entire life. I have had parents who are racist and bigoted and rather believe someone else over me. 

\- I work in a crummy job that people don't listen to me at all.

\- I have no friends or people my age or anyone to listen to me. I also live in a crummy town that has absolutely nothing.

\- No matter what I say or do, nobody cares to listen to me. Plus, I am jealous of people who have good things happen to them and even though when I work for it, it is never good enough for anyone.

\- I feel like sometimes I wish I was never born and everyone would be happy about it. All I am is a burden and a waste of space in life. 

\- Nobody wants to me at all what is going on with me. All they say is 'I know' or 'I understand' or 'Here's a number' without really hearing me.

I truly think I was a waste of air to people and wished that maybe if I was gone, people would be happy. Besides, no one ever really cared about me anyway"

2428,depression,why is it so hard for me to shower,[removed]
2429,depression,I dunno,"i‚Äôm currently laying on my bedroom floor, unable to get the energy to take the three steps to my bed and fall asleep. I have to wake up in 3 hours. oh well, I never sleep nowadays. I used to be able to escape life in my sleep, but now all of my dreams just examine my life in greater detail, leaving me even lower than the night before.

I‚Äôm an 18 year old guy from utah, currently attending college. i‚Äôm a perfectionist, and have always done pretty well academically, but have no energy to act on the impulses. for example, at the start of the year I was taking more credit hours than necessary for full time, but I had to drop classes because I couldn‚Äôt focus in class, let alone even find the motivation to attend. lose-lose situation. either i hate myself for failing a class, or i hate myself for dropping a class. hooray. everything is online, so I have no social interaction. my few ‚Äúfriends‚Äù from high school have completely disappeared and stopped responding to me. I currently have no friends. 0. no irl friends, no internet friends, not even any imaginary friends‚Äîthose just make me long for something real now.

i‚Äôve been depressed for over 5 years now, each month getting lower and lower. last summer I did an experiment to see how many people would text me first. I spent a month not initiating any text conversation. I received 1 text. and they were asking for a favor. I have had suicidal thoughts (and plans) for years, and I actually acted on one a few months ago. unfortunately my parents found me. but that‚Äôs a long, unnecessary story. if i‚Äôm being honest the reason i‚Äôm here tonight is because I have the urge to act on it again. I just hate everything about myself. I hate how I look, what my voice sounds like, how my life is playing out. everything. i‚Äôve been on various medications for months, and i‚Äôve been in and out of therapy. nothing helps.

my girlfriend broke up with me a month or so ago because I wasn‚Äôt religious enough. no joke. everything else was great. we were happy and fit together great, I though that maybe my life was turning around. then she surprised me one day and ended it because I wasn‚Äôt as religious as her. she knew this from the start. I never asked her to give up her values or activities. I never asked her to choose me over religion. all I asked her was to love me for who I am. guess that‚Äôs just too hard. I did everything I could to make her happy. I made every compromise because she ‚Äúcouldnt.‚Äù everything. I guess i‚Äôm just not enough. i‚Äôm not enough for anyone. anything. i‚Äôm just a total failure. I like to think that i‚Äôm not rude or selfish or egotistical or inconsiderate or anything like that. I do my best to never judge people. I accept everyone around me. i‚Äôm always willing to help others and give up everything if it means that i‚Äôm able to make someone else happy. I see people I know and have given everything to help in the past getting married and having interesting lives, I just feel left out and like a failure.

two years ago I had another relationship with a girl. I knew she was way out of my league, but we had always been relatively close, so I didn‚Äôt think twice about it. long story short, she ended up using me to pay for everything and drive her everywhere. she cheated on me twice. that was a great time.

I just don‚Äôt understand what i‚Äôm doing wrong. I don‚Äôt understand why i‚Äôve never been able to have any real, long term friends. why i‚Äôve always just been used in my past relationships. why I always feel left out, and like everyone jokes about me behind my back. does anyone know what i‚Äôm doing wrong? is there some secret thing I had to do when I was 12 to be seen as human? i‚Äôm convinced that it has to be me. i‚Äôm willing to take any suggestions. any criticisms. 

obviously this is just brushing the surface but I already feel like a jerk for wasting your time, if you‚Äôve read this far. and if you have? thank you. thank you for listening to me rant and complain. I‚Äôve never asked for help or posted anything like this before. i‚Äôve never wanted to waste anyone else‚Äôs time, and i‚Äôve always felt like a coward.

2435,depression,I feel like I'm doomed,"I ""woke up"" an hour ago, assuming I had even slept but I'm uncertain. Upon becoming more conscious, the first and only thought I could think of is questioning if I am doomed. I keep a journal to record my thoughts, which I had started doing recently, and I figured I would share what I had written to the internet, though I'm convinced nobody will really read it. I may or may not omit some things, I haven't decided.

Before I get started, I'd like to give a little background to who I am.
I'm a 25 year old line cook, and I like to believe I'm fairly good at my job. It's probably one of the few productive things that I'm actually good at, so I've maintained and improved my work skills over the past five years. Two weeks ago today, I had gotten COVID and luckily avoided many negative thoughts because I was too sick to focus on anything. I have recovered enough to return to work today.
But I think I'll just get started now.

______________________________

AM I doomed? Am I going to continue this path until I'm dead? Is there no way out of my financial hole, where I could possibly achieve some of my dreams and live the life I want, instead of barely scraping by and being forever in debt?
I'm starting to think-- well, not starting, but I think I'm fucked.

I don't think I'm ugly. I don't think I'm necessarily unfortunate in many cases. I'm fairly skinny, tall, and despite my glasses that make my eyes look huge, I've got that going for me. I have a family that loves me, even if it's only immediate.
But I feel like that's it.

I have few friendships, and I believe that the number is few because I'm a bad friend. I miss my dad (who had died ten years ago), partly because I feel like he could have taught me more on how to be a better man. I may have come a long way in the past ten years, yet I feel like my life is ultimately useless. I benefit no one but myself, and only I am to blame on that front.

My debts weigh heavily on my shoulders. I spend too much to actually invest in a vehicle; I spend too much to actually pay my debts. I make too little to do what I want to do. I have spent less than a day, in the last five years, vacationing. I think I'm absolutely fucked. I don't think I can fix myself.

So what do I do? Get counseling that I can't get to? Or continue dwelling on my problems that my father had asked me not to do in his farewell letter to me that I had lost?

Sometimes, like this, I feel like death is my only answer, only I'm too much of a fucking coward to do it myself. I don't like thinking about it because of the implication, but my mother is the biggest reason. My sisters may be able to move on, but my brother would likely be devastated, though I feel he's not long for this world either. That's why I *wish* for death. It's an excuse that can keep my family going.
I really do not believe my life is going to improve; It's only going to get worse, and it's my own damn fault.

I wish for my own death.

After I finish posting this, I'm probably going to write in it again, telling how I'm a whore who expresses his emotions on the internet as a cry for attention. In a way, I don't think I'm wrong.

No, I'm not going to call a suicide hotline, even if the thought does weigh heavily in my heart. As of right now, I know I'm not going to kill myself. I'm too much of a bitch to actually carry out *anything*, even if it was initially a plan to make my future better like getting a car, or even further, a fucking license. Regardless of if I even *had* a plan of any sort, getting COVID and recovering took a long enough time to set me back even further than I had anticipated.

This is all a burden that I carry always, and have carried for longer than ten years. I bought myself this expensive personalized journal and received it two weeks so I could at least *attempt* to get better mentally, and I had bought it because I know that I'm still going to be financially fucked any way I look at it, but so far it's just me complaining about my roommates and recent symptoms.

This excerpt was among the first things I actually bought the journal for. A hope for my future? Perhaps, a step in the right direction? I doubt it.
As I wrote, I'm fucked."

I thought she was happy here and I can‚Äôt help but feel like it‚Äôs my fault. I feel like I just lost my best friend. She‚Äôs gone outside many times, but this is the only time she just left for good. I‚Äôve spent hours walking outside looking for her. She‚Äôs not at shelters or anywhere. I‚Äôm trying to be positive and keep hope that she will come home, but it‚Äôs exhausting. Every time I go search and get excited thinking it‚Äôs her only for it to be another cat. Which others are great too, but I just want mine back. I‚Äôve never had a pet runaway before and I just feel so sad"
2442,depression,My friend wrote an article recently,"He sent me his writing to read, it was not even a great article. He's not great at language.

But this made me realize - he had motivation. I wanted to write since forever but can never make myself start. And it felt really strange to see a person who just... does something. I saw that it's impossible to be understood by non-depressed people, since I can't understand their healthy, motivated perspective.

I started thinking about other situations, where I saw people doing things they're interested in, just because they can and want to. It made me realize that I'm not ""lazy"", but there is something seriously wrong with my mind. It's a scary realization, but somehow comforting. For the first time I was able to accept that I'm not just weird, but actually sick."

Everything right now is painful and I‚Äôm not sure how to escape it. I don‚Äôt want to fight with anyone, I don‚Äôt want to have any chaotic energy or interactions. I just want that light in my life to find it‚Äôs way back to me. Or for me to find it?  I love Avery with my whole heart I can say that for sure but I‚Äôm just now realizing how much I‚Äôm holding back on her cause I‚Äôm so lost and on the verge of breaking down. Nothing excites or stimulates me, I‚Äôm a failure.  Even when trying to go to
school to pursue the thing I loved, I was not energized or fulfilled enough to pursue it properly, I just simply exist, there is so sound or motion in my life. I want to escape this repetitive and stuck body but at the same time I don‚Äôt try to, and I don‚Äôt have the drive, I have burnt out and I feel like death is the only remedy. Suicide if the only thought that seems logical."

2446,depression,why is school keeping me alive,"The only thing keeping me alive is graduating uni, but at the same time uni is causing me so much stress. I cry after completing any assignment or after every meeting. What's the point of living if i'm not doing anything i enjoy and i dont have anything to look forward to after finishing school. I dont like my major and i dont think i could live a life doing anything with it as a job. Why am i making myself suffer when i have no passions or aspirations or anything i find joy in."
2447,depression,I never NEVER do anything right,"And when I say this I truly mean it, there is always something I do wrong or can't do by myself.. Some stupid mistake I make that nobody else even thought of doing, misunderstanding things, forgetting them, not being able to keep up, not being independent, giving up before even trying, not knowing how to say no, being insecure, being bad at literally everything that isn't blindly staring at my phone and mindlessly scrolling for hours.
I have no brain power at all and I have never hated myself so much. I used to be smart (at least in school) and I thought that I would start getting smarter (life wise) but that just isn't happening. I'm in my second year of college and my course work is already a disaster. I missed my first exam because I didn't study at all during the weekend. I don't know my way around the city all that well, I am in a friend group but I don't talk to any of them outside of uni or when we decide to meet up because I don't feel like they would even want to talk to me. I would like to think that I am like this because of my mental health (I don't mean to self diagnose but I'm pretty sure there is something wrong with me tbh) but maybe I'm just dumb and I'm now being forced to face it instead of just hiking myself in my room and remaining in blissful ignorance.
I gave no hobbies that actually require skill, I don't know how to swim and everytime I need to use my brain I go into a state of confusion that makes me do the stupidest things. I don't if it's anxiety or what but it sucks.
I don't want to get up in the morning, I always do tho. I go to my online classes but I never pay attention (I'm in one rn actually), I need to organize myself but I don't know where to start, I need a lot of help but I'm ashamed to ask because it just forces me onece again to realize just how dumb I am.
I always tell my parents everything is fine but everything is not fine and all I want to do most of the time is quit this year of college and go work and make my own money. Get my driver's license and actually prove to myself that I'm not useless. But the truth is that it isn't that easy because I actually have people I consider friends here and breaking the news to them would be nothing short of awful. I don't see things getting better unless I make a radical change but I'm always putting it off.
I don't know where I'm going with this but if you read this far thank you truly."

Im sorry i just needed to rant but today my grandma called over the phone and we called on messenger and we had are camera on and it just breaks my heart because she can't recognize me any longer, I loved my grandma and everyone in my family but I already know the feeling of losing someone, I lost my grandpa years ago and I wasn't even close with my grandpa but I felt down for about a week and cried so hard, I just hate the thought of losing someone even If i just met you and we are connected somehow, ill still get so upset if I hear news about something bad happening to you. My grandma is old,she is in her late 80s and I overheard she threw up again, and she already has a stroke and now the thought of losing her while she can't remember me makes me hate my life more.

2452,depression,Depressed and badly heartbroken,"I have recently came out of an abusive relationship with my ex girlfriend. She used to abuse me emotionally psychologically and then finally physically. 

I found out she was escorting and dominating for money and took her back. I also found out she was sleeping with other men and I took her back from it all. I loved this girl so much. But when I look back on it I don‚Äôt think she ever loved me. I think she was dominating me and getting off on it. She displayed real narcissist behaviour such as gaslighting me. Building me up and tearing me down. Used to even call me her little lost puppy. Never used to show empathy. She used to regularly laugh at her ex boyfriends she claimed she ‚Äúbroke their hearts‚Äù. 

I couldn‚Äôt even tell my friends What was happening out of sheer embarrassment. 


I live in a gang area in the us. And come from a low income housing project. Once I was on the way home and saw a man killed while on the phone to her. There was nobody else on the road just me and this guy. We was both wearing ‚Äúurban‚Äù style clothes. He turnt out to be an innocent man. This could have been me if I hadn‚Äôt gone a different way, I only went that way because my ex had called me and I wanted to talk to her. So I took a longer route. I used to smoke weed but it just had me thinking of me watching this guy die. It used to give me anxiety attacks. Uncontrollable shaking. She noticed that and used to play on it. Saying she gave me a place out the hood to come to. 

She used to always hit me and strike me and I used to restrain her. Until the last time. 
It ended with a big fight and I finally hit her back. 
Her last words she ever said to me before I hit her was ‚Äúcan‚Äôt you see I don‚Äôt respect you. You‚Äôre f***img me after you know I have had sex with other men‚Äù


She went to the police and filed false reports on me which broke my heart so badly. I was in jail dreaming that the charges would get dropped and she would tell the truth but she never did. I felt so betrayed because I stuck by her through everything. She used to cry in my arms while I rocked and kissed her to sleep. She was my first love. 

I am now facing legal battles against her vicious lies trying to defame my character. She always promised I couldn‚Äôt be happy if it wasn‚Äôt with her. And now she‚Äôs going through with her plans. 

I find it hard to eat regularly. 

I go to sleep and wake up in the middle of the night and can‚Äôt get back to sleep. Then sleep all day. 

The ‚Äúhood‚Äù I live in regularly innocent people are killed by accident and it‚Äôs not advised to be out by yourself for no reason. But it‚Äôs weird I‚Äôm not scared of anything anymore just numb. 

I have thought about ending it all but I been through so much even before her. 
I can‚Äôt have been through all that to go out like that. 
That means she will win. 

I‚Äôm a really good hearted person and sometimes
I feel to become a heartless villain and never show anybody love again. But she would still win because she would have changed me forever. 

All this while she‚Äôs enjoying her life. Has a new boyfriend. And regularly cryptically taunts me through her social media accounts. 

Tldr; I‚Äôve been broken by somebody who was my bestfriend. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve never felt so low in my life."
2453,depression,Martyred by hands his own.,"This is my first time writing on reddit. I used to have a passion and a focus in my mind and I had a whole plan of what I wanna be in 5 years. This was back in 2015. I'm 22 years old now and shit couldnt have hit the fan harder than it has in these 5 years. And the worst part is it's all my own fault. I wont blame fate or life or anything  like that because I am the architect of my own undoing and I've dug myself deep enough into rock bottom that I cant climb out of it now. I want to live and thrive but there seems to be no hope. I hesitate to call myself a martyr but that's what comes to my mind when I think of the difference between who I am today and who I was 5 years ago. There seems to be no way out. And even if there was, my lazy and worthless ass would destroy that hope too. I sound disgusting. I am. And I wouldnt expect to not be berated here for what I've done with all my time and my means."
2454,depression,rant,"am I a product of my environment? are my sexual tendencies caused by the constant slut shaming recurved from my parents since I was young or am I making up excuses? 

I remember vividly the time I did my makeup when I was about 10 years old, I was so proud and went to show my dad, in which he called me a whore. I ran away crying and later he came and apologised, saying he was upset and took it out on me. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever forget that, and alongside the more subtle slut shaming by calling my outfits slutty or ‚Äúwhore-ish‚Äù and my mum constantly assuming whenever I go out I‚Äôm secretly hooking up with someone, I think I‚Äôve finally lost all self respect I‚Äôve ever had. 

At this point I don‚Äôt even care, I already know what they think of me and I‚Äôm not surprised, but it still hurts knowing your own parents look at you that way. 

These are the same people who vow to love me no matter what, and to never make me feel less than enough, yet they manage to make me feel the absolute opposite AND make it feel like it‚Äôs my own fault. 

Is it? I can‚Äôt tell. Maybe it is my fault, maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have kissed that one guy, maybe I did this all to myself. Is this a form of self destruction? I don‚Äôt know."

2456,depression,Am I depressed?,"I know self diagnosing is the worst, but I am too afraid to go to therapist and I tried to talk to my sister and mom about it. But my mom says ""just think of happy thoughts and you won't be sad anymore"" or ""Do you think a mother wants to hear their daughter being depressed?"". And my sister rarely replies to me or read my texts. 
In the past I was very suicidal because how my mom used to treat me. When we argued she would say that I'm trash, a piece of sh*** and she would hit me, sometimes threaten me with a knife.
She doesn't treat me like that anymore, but it left a scar on me.
Now I am attending college and live in a dorm so I don't get to talk to them face to face.
 The reason why I  believe I may have depression is because I feel numb, worthless, and a waste of space. But these feelings are hidden and I have always kept it hidden. I blocked these emotions for years and it started to come back to the surface.
I want to talk to someone about feeling depressed, my roomate at least or my Uncle (who I rarely talked to, but I know he knows what it feels like), but I have trust issues. I don't want them to report me, or tell my mom about this. Since I'm not going to take action, but I just want someone to talk to.

We don't really hang out and I can never seem to be on her level intellectually. When ever we fight I'm always the bad guy and maybe I am... I moved in with her because I thought we would be able to help each other out with negative self talk and obviously it hasn't worked.

2460,depression,My mom finally understood,"This last month has been the worst of my life. I started seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist in September, but I still haven't gotten a diagnosis or started with medicines.

Recently my school has started online classes again, and I can't bring myself to focus. No matter how hard I try, I can't. I don't remember the last time I did my homework. I talked about this with my therapist and they told me it's okay (which made me feel a lot better, because I was blaming myself), and that it's better if, until I start feeling better, I stop trying to focus or do my homework or to do anything in general. I told this to my mom, and finally she said that it's okay. We cried together for like an hour, and decided that I will take a break from school. I feel kinda guilty, but I do feel better. Even though none of my friends checked up on me today that I missed 3/4 of my classes. But it's probably because they're used to me skipping school lol.

2462,depression,Understand thy neighbour,"What happens when you no longer feel like doing anything anymore?  Laying in bed until the afternoon.. Binge eating or under eating. Gaining lots of weight or losing a tone of weight. Spending countless hours on the phone scrolling through media that means nothing to you. Losing confidence in one self, suicidal thoughts, suicidal attempts.

Do only ‚Äúweak beta fools‚Äù experience this as some of us like to say? As much as it is wise to not be a victim in life we do have to accept the fact that our environment can play a huge role in our mental state. You will find it difficult to thrive when you feel you have no control with your life, you cannot create when working a job that is unfulfilling. You will find it hard wear a smile on your face when those around you lack understanding of why you might behave in a certain way and you certainly will find it challenging to want to stay alive everyday since you feel nobody has interest in your wellbeing. ‚ÄúUh but life is tough so sit down and shut up and make better choices!‚Äù Do not say such things to an individual you would suspect to be depressed. ‚ÄúDepression is just an excuse for laziness!‚Äù There is nothing I dislike more than those who speak like that, thinking that what worked for them is going to work for everyone else. Don‚Äôt be a fool, parents, friends and teachers make this mistake all the time when someone closes to them is having a difficult time with their mental state. 

If you know anyone in your household, work or friend group who you suspect might be going through this, avoid your pointless un-empathetic nagging with your ‚Äútough love‚Äù you might eventually actually drive them to suicide just in case you didn‚Äôt know.. ‚Äúoh but it‚Äôs not my responsibility if someone kills themselves or not‚Äù. Well... Of course it isn‚Äôt and to be quite frank the whole world could blow up tomorrow and it will not make a difference to the rest of the universe but I will say this... Everyone is different, circumstances do affect someone‚Äôs choice makings in life and does affect the way someone is going to respond to adversity and those people who had any form of hardship no matter what the hierarchy of the pain was will be sensitive. ‚ÄúOh but you can grow out of it‚Äù. Sure but not with those around them who mock and ridicule them. Make an effort to listen to your neighbour, love your neighbour. It‚Äôs hard time for all of us for sure.

2463,depression,If I were to disappear no one would notice/care,"Very lonely lately. I‚Äôm have a lot of social anxiety and it doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôve struggled tremendously to meet friends both online and off. 

I recently have been thinking about how if I were to just disappear one day, no one would notice.

If I were to vanish no one would notice, and I‚Äôd most likely never be thought of again"
2464,depression,"What's the point of getting help, if I'll still never amount to anything","I've had chronic depression for something like 15 years now, over half my life, I've only ever gotten any medicine for about a year of it, and all they did was make me feel constantly nauseous. Never had any followup from the psychiatrist or my doctor regarding me stopping the meds.

So anyway yea, as the title says, recently I've been thinking about how, even if I do somehow miraculously get help get better, I don't see how it'll matter. I'll still be stuck in the same pit that I'm in, unable to get out, move on or make anything of my life. So what's the point?  *What's the point in expending time and energy on trying to get better, when it won't matter in the grand scheme of things.* Especially when I don't plan on sticking around much longer than a couple years anyway.

For a bit of clarification, I've been ""blessed"" by life with the sweet trifecta that is Chronic Depression, Anxiety and Autism. Just awesome really. So even if I did somehow get my depression under control, the other two are bad enough that they'd still prevent me from going outside my apartment more than I already do (about 2-3 times a month for groceries, only go out because I can't afford to get deliveries), get any sort of job, contribute to society in literally any way, or make *any* sort of meaningful connections with other people.     

It was hard enough getting them to prescribe any meds originally, because according to them ""Autism and Depression mimic each other quite a lot, so it's gonna be hard to tell which symptoms stem from what"". And with any sort of therapy help out the window (can't go outside my apartment, or talk to new people even on the phone/VOIP), I'm just not really sure how worth it it'll be for me to try and fight for getting meds that *might* help, or might make it worse (and cost me money I don't really have).

Anyway, not really sure how to end this post so.. yea."

Nothing around me makes me feel joy. I just... sit here, faking it, hoping the feeling will come back. Years go by, and it just all feels so empty. I have no desire to live. No desire to die. Quite frankly, there aren't many desires left at all. I'm just, so bored of existing. So tired of being. 

The drugs dont work. The counseling doesn't work. Gratefulness practices didnt help. Meditation didnt help. It's been 17 years since the first time I genuinely wanted to stop existing, and the feeling never went away. Almost two decades of counseling, learning, and attempting to feel happy."
2475,depression,Am I okay?,"It's insanity when someone asks if I'm okay. My mom did 2 days ago. And what if I am okay? For this moment. Then what? We're all here just slowly sliding back into the hole we are trying to escape. Sure, I'm okay for a moment just like you, clinging to the side of this mountain that we're both slipping down. Sure. We're both okay. We're okay. But that doesn't change the fact that we're both heading toward this hole. We're not going to get away from that. That's where we're going, so what's the point of climbing any further? Does ""okay"" mean I'm still climbing? Or that I've stopped to take a breather. Am I okay if I'm taking a breather? Or what if I decided to let go and climb down to that hole. Can I be okay then?

We aren't doing anything important here. We crawled out of that hole for what? What are we going to do here that is so important and vital? I can't think of one thing that, when I examine it, is really worth it all. I think the hole sounds better."

2478,depression,Boyfriend of 3.5 years cheated on me for 6 months,He's the only person who's ever loved me in the way I thought I deserved and now it feels like I can never be loved completely and fully by anybody. I'm so alone and I'm so sick of my life it's hard not to relapse. It's hard to be sober. It's hard to care about anything going on in my life. I want to die. This is not something I can come back from. Too much has happened in my life for me to start over again just to be betrayed like this again. 3.5 years of my life down the drain. I cannot function. We had a cat. We were signing a lease. I did not plan to be alone like this. I did not plan for my life to be filled with hatred and sadness and just numb. He should have been helping me with dinner tonight. He should have helped me build the chairs today. He should be paying half the fucking rent. I'm all alone.

2479,depression,I Don't Want to Do This Anymore,"I don't have a life. I want one, but I don't have one. I don't know how to meet people. I don't know where I'm supposed to meet people. I don't even care it's a global fucking pandemic anymore. 

I'm tired of having to answer the question ""So what did *you* do this weekend?"" with ""Nothing."" I'm tired of having happiness fill me with rage.

I'm tired of everything making me bitter.
I'm tired of everything just letting me down. Online dating? Fucking sucks for average people, even worse if you're a loser. Writing contest? Haha. Good luck. Luck of chance meeting of people? Yeah like that's going to fucking happen.

Not like any of this matters since we're either going to end up in a dystopian hellscape or get fucked by climate change anyway, so I don' t even know why I care about finding happiness so much.

I have goals that keep drifting farther and farther away and no one gives a fuck.

2480,depression,I lie to myself everyday about not being depressed.,"Every single fucking day I have to lie to myself and say I won't get depressed.

Any day now I'll finally give in again and just lay in bed all day praying that I don't wake up. 

I'll go to work. Come ""home"". Lay down. Pray that I don't wake up. 

Praying that I don't wake up makes me feel at peace. But when I wake up, it's like fuck, now I have to wait until tonight to pray I die again. 

I really made a lot of stupid decisions in my life. And I constantly go through a rollercoaster of depressed / pretending I can fight it. 

Fuck medication, it didn't do shit. The only result I get is when I get angry and say I'm not going to be depressed anymore. But it only lasts so long. I'm not as strong as people in my life think I am. And I know that they're just taking advantage of me. 

My body and mind are deteriorating at an alarming right recently for no apparent reason and all I want is some fucking relief. Oh yeah, I can't tell anyone because in this day and age I'll get fucking committed to the hospital, or better put, hospital jail. Fuck that place, I'm not going back."

She is dating another close friend and might be pregnant. Oh, then my friend died in a car accident last Thursday. I should also add I have recently started suspecting that I was molested when I was young.

I've had drug problems in the past, I've been sober for 7 months, but it's hard right now. Not even just the temptation to numb the pain, I just feel too young to be sober. I'm 17, I want to just be able to smoke a joint with friends or take some shots, I'm not even really wanting to do pills again. I don't know what to do, I don't want to do anything to numb the pain, I can live with the pain, I just want to be able to be like that with my friends again, unwind in that way.

I regret holding back my tears when we put him down. I dont even know why I did it, I dont know and I really regret it because I feel like I turned my back on him when he was in his lowest state.

I regret never telling my feelings to the people around me, and still not doing so even though I want to but I just can't being myself to.

Why am I like this. Why must I fuck up everything when all I try to do is make other people happy.

2493,depression,Feeling locked in,"Recent events in my life have caused me to spiral even further. I've called a crisis line every day for like five days. They just tell me to hang in there, to keep doing what I'm doing. I'm taking care of myself as best I can but I can't get to sleep until like 3am, can barely eat, can barely leave the house. 

The few things I have on my plate aren't serving me well, I don't look forward to them each week and I often cancel. There's no one there or here at home for me to speak to about anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't identify anything that I want to do at the immediate, minute-to-minute level. I don't want to watch TV, or eat (not even junk food), or do things around the house. For whatever reason there is so much internal resistance at the thought of doing anything. I'm in unbearable emotional pain. And separately, the thought of doing nothing triggers anxiety over never changing anything, being told that I'm the only one who can pull myself out of it, never making anything of myself or having anything to respect myself for.

The only things I would probably have any motivation for would be things where other people show me they actually care about me and want to spend time with me. I was staring at the wall for a little while before I got the idea to walk to the other side of the house to grab my laptop, to check another post I had made a few days ago. 

I feel completely powerless. I dread the thought of things coming up that I am not preparing for (bands I play with for which I am not practicing music). I want to be doing well enough to keep going with those things, but I'm not. But I can't let go and I end up stuck doing things I'm not prepared for, which then makes me feel bad when I'm not doing things very well."

Been filling a little down for about the past year or so, and its been getting progressively worse.   The past 4 months or so,  suicidal thoughts have been happening more frequently.   I can honestly say the only reason I'm still here is because of my kids.  My wife found out about a week ago when I finally broke down and told her.  She does everything she can to help, but she struggles with slight depression and anxiety as well.   While at work,  I had time to think about it and pinned down the issue,  I think.   About the time it ask started all my friends I was stationed with PCSd.  Being an NCO, I'm usually the guy who has to be the bad guy and issue paperwork to the lower enlisted, so in my off time none of them want to talk to me much less be around me, and all the other NCOs seem to do their own thing.

I hate myself. I just want to stop it all. I just want to end it all. I keep wanting to jump off my house and land on my neck tonight. 

I hate that I am never like this around friends. I feel the need to put up a mask and act ok. I‚Äôve only broken down to one friend. I told him about everything and just cried. Now I just feel. Empty."
2502,depression,"The job market, closed borders and isolation are slowly pushing me over the edge.","Title says it all. I just graduated from my masters and I've been struggling in the job market. It's exponentially More important for me to find a job given that I am an international student and have visa constraints. In addition to this I live alone with no friends or family in a single room and sometimes feel like I'm in a prison. Lastly my girlfriend is in the US and is unable to come to Canada due to closed borders. Canada recently allowed partners to come visit, however since I am not a citizen I cannot ask her to come visit. All of this is really weighing on me and I'm losing my mind. I don't know how much longer I can hold on"
2503,depression,"You don't know me, but let me introduce myself.","I'm 16 years old and I've struggled with depression on and off for  6 years since my parents got a divorce. My dad neglected me for a while and wouldn't buy me food. He made comments about my weight and I started eating by myself and alone in the dark when I was in 6th grade. My dad worked long hours and he'd ignore my sister and I whenever we would try to talk to him. I had to raise my sister after that. He always invalidates my feelings after harassing me and telling him I have to tell him how I feel.

My mom struggles with mental illness and she was depressed after the divorce. She'd never come out of her room. She always picked fights with me and told me she couldn't wait until I went to my dad's house. My mom told me that I was almost the reason she killed herself and that I'm the reason she's on antideppresants. 

Plus so many other details, but I don't feel like writing them out.

The one thing that made everything better for a while was having a support system. Since the pandemic, I've lost all of my friends. Not a single person will answer my calls. I had my heart broken earlier and I was crying and I had nobody. Not a single person wants me or wants to talk to me. 

I would stay up all night to just have a normal conversation with the people in my life. 

I feel so let down and hurt. I just need to be told that I'm loved and I need support. I feel like I'm going crazy. 

As my depression has worsened, I've stopped eating as much and I'm just laying in bed all day. I didn't even think I'd make it to 16. There's truly no way I'll make it to college next year or to 18. I don't know if I want to run away or kill myself. I just can't do this anymore."
2504,depression,I love how people can act like they relate,"My sister acts like she knows what I‚Äôm talking about, but unless you are going through that phase you have no idea.

2505,depression,Just thinking,I moved from Alaska to Florida with my girlfriend that lived in Alaska with me for 2 1/2 years. Been here 10 months now. I have no friends. Nobody back home checks on me to see if I‚Äôm okay. I‚Äôm hardly making enough money to pay my bills and get by. Life has never been easy for me and it‚Äôs always been a struggle. I just want something to look up for me is all. I lost my grandpa last year to cancer and it still really affects me to this day. Mine and my girlfriends schedules never match up so the only time we get together we‚Äôre sleeping most likely so I don‚Äôt get to go out and adventure or do anything. I‚Äôm home sick and alone and sad.

2509,depression,Is it okay to settle for a life of relative comfort and unfulfilling contentment?,"For most of my life I‚Äôve felt kind of lost and alone, and I don‚Äôt feel any kind of drive or desire to do anything in life. Growing up I was allowed next to no time to socialize with my peers outside of school, and I moved frequently on top of that, so losing friends became a part of life for me. My parents were often cold and cruel on top of that, hurting me physically and with their words for the crime of existing as I am. They often humiliated me and belittled me, but were nice when they wanted me to do something. 

I stopped moving for the most part once I reached middle school, and things started to get better. I was friendly with my classmates, and talked with them outside of school as well, but after middle school ended, many of us went to different schools, and I lost touch with them not long after. When I reached high school I felt so disillusioned with life that I felt if more of this was all I had to look forward to, then I would rather have no part of it. And so began the most self-destructive part of my life.

Despite my reservations, I knew that what I was feeling wasn‚Äôt healthy, and I wanted help. I knew I couldn‚Äôt rely on my few remaining friends since we were friends mostly nominally, and I couldn‚Äôt rely on my parents either. If it still isn‚Äôt clear why I couldn‚Äôt rely on my parents, they couldn‚Äôt have cared less about my mental health, and as far as they were concerned, there was no such thing. 

I initially tried reaching out at school, to my guidance counselor. I was performing poorly in a subject my first semester, and she requested a meeting with me, which I thought would be the perfect time. Due to fear of the school reaching out to my parents if I admitted anything directly, I decided to ‚Äúcry out for help‚Äù using doublespeak and body language. I know this may make it seem like it‚Äôs my own fault, but I sincerely hoped she would understand that SOMETHING was wrong and ask more about it, at which point I would‚Äôve elaborated. Unfortunately, she reacted in the worst way possible, in a way I never expected. She essentially laughed at me and looked at me like I was some miserable creature unfit to live, and this attitude would continue through all of my dealings with her until I ended up transferring schools.

Before I transferred schools, found someone else at my school who I could talk to. They acquired a therapist to work in the building in my sophomore year, and I started talking to her after I found out about her in my junior year. She soon had me hospitalized for suicidal ideation and I spent almost one month there. I was scared at first, but it really did help, and I felt so good by the time I was released. Sadly, it didn‚Äôt last. Despite ongoing outpatient therapy and varying medications for a little over 6 months, I spiraled down into a hell I never even imagined before my hospitalization. I genuinely believed it would‚Äôve been better to have died than suffer like that, but I could barely pull myself out of bed most mornings.

As for what triggered it? Returning to my old life. I still felt good on the first day back. My parents pretended to be nice to me, but my mom snapped back to her usual self almost immediately, yelling at me and cursing at me, asking what the hell was wrong with me and calling me selfish and useless, as she always has. I then realized that my actual life would never match the fantasy I was shown in that hospital. I soon started cutting all of my classes at school, instead taking a nap in a quiet corner of the school. Eventually I stopped going all together. I had no friends who would go out of their way for me there, as up to then, I preferred crying in a corner feeling sorry for myself over socializing. My parents did not take this well as you can imagine, but I won‚Äôt get into that. 

I don‚Äôt know what triggered it exactly, but the following summer, I decided that I would start working hard for my future, not to be happy, but so that I can be free of my parents like I‚Äôd always wanted, and so that I can suffer alone in comfort, rather homelessness. After all, money doesn‚Äôt solve all your problems, but it‚Äôs better to cry in a Mercedes than in a cardboard box on the street. Any similar shitty quote works too. I got into a decent college not long after, majoring in engineering, mostly off of my SAT scores, but my grades my senior year were the highest they ever were. I managed to get lucky and nailed enough scholarships to get myself a mostly free ride. If I hadn‚Äôt managed that, I would genuinely rather have killed myself than bother taking on that much debt, in fact I had planned to if I couldn‚Äôt manage a workaround.

Despite their flaws, my parents have been rather supportive of me in college. I don‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôve changed their ways, but they are supporting me financially. As far as their attitudes go, instead of trying to change them, I‚Äôve finally settled for manipulating them to serve my interests. I‚Äôve realized that they will never be the parents I needed, certainly not ones I wanted, but I only have to suffer them a little longer, then I can cut them off when I no longer need them. If you think this makes me as bad as them, it may, but in a different way, and I probably will end up maintaining some kind of relationship with them anyway.

Right now, I‚Äôm in my second year of college, and I‚Äôm doing well academically, and fine with my extracurriculars, but more and more I‚Äôm struggling to get myself to be productive. More and more, i‚Äôm sleeping in and sleeping late, and spend hours everyday binge watching anime (which I love, and is one of the few good things in my life, the others being sleep and music, mainly).

Despite everything, I still only work hard because I want a relatively comfortable life, working a decent job until I die. I‚Äôve pretty much given up on friendships and dating at this point, and all I want is a quite life where I can be healthy, comfortable, and do the things I enjoy (like watch anime) outside of work. A part of me still wants to die and in my mind I don‚Äôt see myself living past my late 20s-early 30s and have no desire to. But I‚Äôm ok with that. I tried counseling services at school before COVID, but it wasn‚Äôt doing much for me. I can‚Äôt afford any other kind of care right now, but I doubt it‚Äôll help anyway tbh.

Sorry if it seems a little incoherent or if the majority of this post seems unnecessary, I just wanted to give a little context to make it a little more clear how I got here. What do you think?"
2510,depression,I hate this,"I‚Äôve seen several therapists and like 4 psychiatrists, been on a bunch of different medications, and none of it helps. 

My core belief, the one that cannot ever be changed by ECT, therapy, medications, family, or any remaining friendships, is that there is nothing I want more than suicide. No amount of positive thinking or CBT or DBT changes that I want to die. NOTHING WILL EVER CHANGE THAT, AND I DONT WANT IT TO CHANGE. I WANT TO KILL MYSELF AND NOT BE JUDGED OR STOPPED.

I‚Äôve tried suicide several times, but unfortunately get my stomach pumped or am reported before I get to attempt. I‚Äôve been to several psych hospitals, including Yale, and am still just as hopeless and worthless at the beginning. Nothing has changed my mind, only wasted my time. If anyone besides the terminally ill should qualify for euthanasia, it should be the people who don‚Äôt want to be alive. The people like me, who can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt be helped. 

ALL I WANT IS A HUMANE AND EASY WAY OUT. THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM THIS. 

There is no end to the loneliness and wish to have never been born. Fuck everyone who waste time trying to discourage suicide. People who are determined eventually find a way, and others end up happy to see them go. I hope you all hope I can finally kill myself. I know you all can‚Äôt wait to see me leave this Reddit community alone."

Every time I do something that I find cringe or something I judge myself I know I mostly do this because of my judgemental parents and it's rubbed off on me a lot.

I‚Äôm confident and have few serious body issues. I like my job. I love my wife. I love my parents and my friends. But I‚Äôm still sad at night.

Moments of joy are ruined by the creeping feeling of temporariness. 

Today I had a wonderful day with my wife and an extremely positive and optimistic evening. But the feelings of death, that this moment can‚Äôt last forever, and the death of myself and the subsequent ruining of my loved ones lives... all of those feelings distract me and bum me out. 

It makes me almost want to spend less time with my wife so that the feelings of happiness aren‚Äôt there in the first place.

I love her, and we‚Äôve been together since we were teens, and I don‚Äôt know how either of us would function if one were to die. 

How do you deal with these feelings? The fear that all of this will one day end, and others will inevitable be left with sadness and incompleteness? How do I stop being sad when I‚Äôm happy?"
2519,depression,Why is it insisted I stay alive?,"Trigger warning I guess, I need to go off. If you're feeling down, please don't read this, I'm going dark. I need to ask some hard questions and present some hard angles as I've seen them. I decided against the suicide reddits because I'm really not planning that or feel near it. Quite the contrary, I'm at the moment feeling a bit angry that I don't feel free to.

Now I know I should be grateful for the stigma because it's helped me stay alive, but that again assumes, circularly, that I want that.

Why does everyone care so much if I kill myself?

So here's the story of me, a screwed up trouble child depression kid who beat the odds, won it all, and just fucking lost it.

Now I grew up... I was a dick, to be short and understated. Maybe I deserve all this, but here's why I don't feel up to the life thing rn other than not wanting to hurt people...

My Fiance is leaving me, we've been together since just after highschool, met in school. Classic highschool sweethearts, but we were everything but normal. My life was really really shitty before we got together and she made it amazing. We made each other's lives better no doubt, got along decent, pretty common there. Won't share details but we're still great friends (for now, more on that later, I might just be deluding myself honestly) and staying rooming together for the time until certain things can get sorted out, but there's no chance of getting back together, or rather, there's ridiculously little chance, and nothing I could purposely do would really help. No one did anything wrong, I don't get to hate her, it's just over.

Here's the fucking thing though. I just don't want to live without her, and fighting for her back just isn't a thing here.

Now when I say I don't want to live without her, I'm sure a lot of people's first thought is ""codependency for sure"". But here's the thing, chaps, it's not that life is the worst thing ever without her, it's not that I can't breath because she's a drug I need (although mild versions of those things have certainly been felt recently). I just loved her, and it just hurts that she's gone, and everything seems shitty now, I don't want it. She's gotten over it super quickly, that's how she is, and she's pretty much just excited now, I'm still devastated. 

Now look I'm completely aware I could make this life whatever I want, but I don't fucking want anything. I want a person and you can't have whatever person you want, they're people, when they go they go. So what is the fucking point? I start over? I go, ""oh well yeah that hurt like fuck let's go another decade with someone and maybe we'll get lucky and someone will die before the relationship collapses""? Or I could just fuck and be single my whole life, and die lonely, both great options /s.

So here's the big Q.

Why can't I just give a calm no fucking thanks, honestly? Exit the game?

If everyone wasn't pushing stigma... just no thanks. If everyone would just let me leave, just no thanks. I want to exit the game, it's just fucked and I don't like it. People don't even have the same concept of death, how is this so universal? 

And thus here we are with the only reason I remain in this world being that it hurts other people if I leave. Is this hell? What kind of place makes you beg for death while telling you it's off limits and will cause other people the pain that makes you want death? What a mind job...

I just wanted her. That was it. I was simple, I just wanted love and I was good, other shit sucked ass but I didn't care, I had her. As far as I was concerned everyone and everything else could suck it because I had finally won. I saw people talking about how much dating sucks these days all the time on facebook and shit, thought it just seemed disgusting, unfulfilling, and I was so grateful. I was so grateful y'all. I wasn't snoody about it like ""these people are stupid for dating"" I was just so happy I had my person and she made me happy and we were set. We weren't having sex near the end for various reasons, but I saw all the sex and stuff on TV, thought ""don't need that, I found the one, that's all I need, that's all those people are doing is just looking for what I have right here, thank fuck"". 

That was a couple weeks ago, that guy was on top of the world. He worked hard to get there, too. Fought depression his whole life. He thought for a brief moment, ""wow, it really IS worth hanging in there"". He thought every once in a while a good thing would actually happen, that real lasting happiness was real. It's not, it's fleeting, best case scenario you die. So that's why I can't die? I'm waiting for the best case scenario, which is also dying, just at a less convenient time?

Now she's leaving, and maybe we'll be friends, but single me (long time ago) was a jackass who made any woman (really anyone) hate him within a week or two tops so we'll fucking see. For a moment I though, I REALLY thought, that I wasn't that fuckup of a guy anymore, but I'm already kind of stirring up trouble to be vague. 

She helped me get through college, I'm 6 months tops away from a degree, I should have a car soon, I have some cool projects in the works that should bring in some money...

But all of that was for us. I never had much ambition, wanted a pretty simple life, liked to have fun with friends, was always crushing on someone. But after I met her, oh man, I wanted to build the world for us. I could finally picture the townhome with the picket fence that used to disgust me, and the home projects, and the dog, and we got a dog, we have a dog, I always always wanted a dog. I didn't want a dog alone. They were my family, I don't much talk to the rest of my family, they're mostly angry and judgementally religious. Now I'm sleeping on the couch because sleeping in the same bed is uncomfortable.


So now I'm stuck in this position where I materially speaking have near nothing, though I don't really care. I have a lot of material potential though, but I don't fucking care for it. Im working on my projects because I know I'm supposed to. They'll make me money which I won't want, so I can buy things which I won't fucking want, so I can go on living which I also don't fucking want. I'm doing all of this mostly just to look okay for other people.

I'm exhausted. I fought hella mental disorders my whole life. It was so hard. I fought for our relationship, we both really, really did. It was so hard. Battled financial struggles, family struggles... All hard. College? Hard as fuck and I tried to start a business while doing it, which I had to leave after sinking a year into it, which was hard. It was all so fucking hard.

All the while I believed it would get better.

And it did.

Then it got worse, fucking collapsed, all at once. It's not poetic, it's not well written, there's no fate, no comedy here, no happy ending. Certainly no choose your own ending. Just a shitty twist that made no sense and a ""to be continued"". To be continued with what? Fuck this book, right?

Like, just why? You fight like hell just to get shat on.

So here I am, living for all of you I guess. Living with a figurative mask on because I told her she shouldn't worry about me because I don't want to be a burden, even though I want her to worry about me because shes the only person who really ever gave a shit about me. Here I am living in a world id rather exit because you all demand I stay. Figuratively speaking, I have to wonder if you're demons or fellow prisoners. Do you convince me to stay in attempt to convince yourself it's worth it? Or perhaps a sense of obligation created by higher ups?

The children's stories speak of love, and tell you to ignore the material world.

Then people inevitably lose someone they care about in one of infinite ways and we turn around and say ""you'll find someone else, don't worry about it, look you still have money, isn't that great?"". 

One soul is equivalent to another and money matters most? What happened to the happy squirrels vibe?

This existence is pain for me, so I'm sorry if this post was hard for anyone to read, or scary, or dangerous.

But I need someone to explain to me what the fucking point is right about now. 

Why am I being detained? You have nothing to show me, I. had. everything. And I don't want it again. It hurt to lose it and I liked the one I had. God is a little too fucking giddy up there with replacing shit sometimes if you ask me.

Am I supposed to be happy even though I no longer get to be with the love of my life? Why would I keep fighting depression just for another shot at fighting depression? I'm supposed to take just money and go find someone else and just say ""this one will do then""? No one even fucking stays. I always felt that way and thought ""you're just traumatized"", but then this shit, and even if I found one fucking person to stay, great, good job me, I get to be with them until one of us inevitably dies?

I already had it all. I had everything that everyone wants. If everything is temporary I'll take my memories and leave, thanks.

Anyone who made it here, thanks for reading all that. Ftr I'm not a danger to myself (or anyone else (somewhat-obviously)) at the moment, and I have several people I can call if I'm feeling across a certain line. But I'm irritated atm that the world considers it wrong for me to leave, and I could use a non shitty reason for anything to exist in a way where nothing stays."
2520,depression,I‚Äôm so alone and my life is going nowhere.,I don‚Äôt have anyone or anything anymore. I have 1 friend (kinda) and we only occasionally talk. It never gets deep and I dont feel like I can‚Äôt go to him with my problems. I‚Äôm failing all my classes and the end of the semester is coming up in December. It‚Äôs a struggle just to keep myself living let alone keep good grades. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore or where to turn to anymore. I‚Äôm running out of reasons to live and reasons to care. If I died today people would only care for a month max. They would get over me quickly and live their normals lives but that‚Äôs honestly what I want. I get to end my pointless life and be forgotten while everyone gets to be happy and live theirs. It‚Äôs a win win. I don‚Äôt think I have much time left.

i was so fucking depressed during highschool. i would just skip days, sleep through entire classes, not do any assignments, all that hreat stuff. i thought about ending it every fucking day. after school i would go home to a super toxic household. my mom has so many mental issues and my dad gets angry at anything. i went to therapy, shit got better. i powered through senior year with a positive outlook on life for once. so covid hits and im done with highschool and i got into a pretty alright college. i was so ready to really start life. make new friends, see new places, blablabla. but it didnt turn out that way. now im here doing online school and i have never felt more alone in my life. like its genuinely painful how lonely i am. i see friends every now and then but i still feel nothing. my depression has gotten worse and so has my anxiety. life is just so terrible rn i cant even try to explain it all

stress, isolation, depression

the only times i feel at peace are when im asleep or listening to music.

besides that. life is miserable."
2523,depression,I want to die but I know I don't want to die.,"Hello. I'm 23, Asian, Female, with a Bachelor's degree that I don't need. 

Like most people, I'd like to be alive and happy because dying sounds painful and I hate pain.

But sometimes when I feel so much pain mentally and physically, I wish I could just drop dead because I can't go see a doctor or get emotional support from my family and friends.

I don't have money for doctors and I'm too afraid to talk to my family or friends. I tried before and it was either they start talking about themselves or say ""it'll pass"", ""push through"", ""everybody is having a hard time"".  It hurts that I can't just talk and someone would just listen and nod.

I know I'd do the same as my family or friends tho. I'm not a therapist.

Anyways.

I always felt alive while I draw but now it's really painful to do it. I don't know what I did to myself. I just wanted to succeed as an artist. I wanted to be noticed and loved for creating great work. Make money and show my family that artists don't become homeless. I wanted to prove to myself and others that being an artist isn't something you should constantly worry about or be told ""if you don't do what I want, I'll make you do nursing major"" or ""stop doodling and make something great"".

Now I can't even draw without feeling so rotten on the inside. Thoughts are just going on in my head.  They won't shut up. Constantly whispering, ""this'll make money"", ""this'll get lot of likes"", ""I'm such a failure"", ""I can't even draw so why try"", ""I'm not an artist. I draw for likes"", ""I should just give up"".

Only I can get myself back up but I have no motivation and have no clue on how to get motivated.

I feel like I'm losing everything. Just rotting away. I hate my family for saying those things at me. I don't care if they came from a loving place. It hurt and it sucked.

I don't trust anyone. I don't trust myself either.

And I have no idea what to do about it. I tried so many times to fix it but I failed every time.

I'm done trying. It's like swimming with a rock tied to my leg.

Life is sucks so hard. I want to die but I really don't at the same time."

2525,depression,I've never been diagnosed but I think I have severe depression.,"I have posted here before, even though no on reads them but I have known for a long time I am depressed, or at least suffering mentally bit it's gotten unstable. I've never actually been diagnosed by a doctor with depression but I think it's safe to assume I am very depressed. Some symptoms I've been having are of the following: Getting extremely tense and breakdown because I can't do simple tasks (I had a mental breakdown because I failed misreblely at washing a fucking cheese grater), Never want to move or get our of bed, Almost lost consciousness because I wasn't eating, Crying every day and tried to self-harm on multiple occasions with a particular serrated kitchen knife. I have no fucking idea if I do have severe depression or if anyone will read this and quite frankly I do not give a shit anymore. I'm wasting my youth with tears and soon I'm going to drown in them."
2526,depression,"I'm at the point now where when people ask me what's going on, I tell the complete unfiltered truth.","I'm exhausted. I just stopped talking to everyone. I don't even have the patience to lie anymore. In the very rare instances when people ask me how I am, I just say I'm miserable and I want to die. I'm not even joking or trying to be edgy about it. 

""No! Don't say that!""

Why not? I am miserable. I want to die. You want me to lie about it? You want me to say I'm okay? I'm not okay. Why should I tell you any different? Don't want to hear it? Don't ask. 

I feel like I'm preparing for the end. I think that I'm being very flippant about my feelings because I just care anymore. I know that this is never going to end. I know that I just have to take this all into my own hands. I know that I'm running out of time. 

""But you have so much to live for?""

Like what? Why does everyone keep lying to me about this? I have a lot to live for? Life is so wonderful? Everything will be okay? How? How on Earth is everything going to be okay? Nothing has been okay for 32 fucking years. What do I have to live for? Why don't you just tell me what it is that I have to live for? If I were hungry would you tell me about food, or would you give me something to eat? I don't need to hear that it will get better, I need it to get better. 

Sometimes I envision my anger and depression as a fire raging in my chest. I daydream that one day that fire will burst out of me and devour everything. I can see the entire world engulfed in my hatred."

2540,depression,"My parents believe depression meds and therapy is bad for you and ""for the weak"".","Ok, so I'm a 14F and I have undiagnosed depression. It has negatively affected me a lot recently because I have had to do online school where you work at your own pace and I have bad procrastination habits and I get distracted easily. Not to mention the motivation issues I have because of depression. Also the constant worry that my parents will contract the coronavirus and get very sick and/or die because the US is handling the pandemic horribly.

So about my parents... They are very religious and they believe that mental health isn't that serious of an issue. I love my parents but I am struggling everyday to the point where it affects the rest of my family (with my depression I am having problems with my sleep schedule and the amount of sleep my body craves) as well as my grades (I have gotten all A's up to this point).

My parents seem to only want to argue with me why they are right instead of actually helping me with my mental health. They have sat me down and tried to have a conversation with me about my mental health but when I share my struggles with them (which is sometimes difficult because I have a hard time explaining some things in a way that makes sense) they tell me to ""just do __, it's not that hard"" (for example, I say that I have trouble motivating myself to do things like schoolwork and they say something like ""oh, well I have to do work at my job, if I can do it you can too."" And ""motivation comes from inside you, you're just telling yourself that you aren't motivated because you want an excuse not to do it.""

(TW?) My parents also like to use mention of depression medications and therapy as a way to mock me (for example, I tell them that I am having a hard time coping with my mental health issues and they say things like ""oh, so what do you want me to do about it? Do you want drugs?"" As if depression medications aren't effective and the only reason I am bring up my depression is because I want to get addicted to drugs or something. They also strongly imply that wanting/taking depression meds is weak because other people can ""just deal with it and get back to life as normal""). Another thing that really bothers me about that is the fact that they bring it up randomly when I'm just going about my day. Like I would just be watching a movie or something with the rest of my family and the movie would mention something about mental health medications and my parents would address me in some way. Like, I'm already struggling enough with depression, I don't need everyone to point out that they think virtually the only thing that could help me is bad, especially if I was having a good time before.

They do kind of have a reason to think that depression medication is bad, though. I know a lot of my family members from my mom's side had a history of taking depression medications and seeming to lose some of their emotion. For me, though, I've had worse depressive episodes where I felt like I had no emotion, so would the medicine have any different effect? I also think that it would be more healthy in the long run to cure my depression than to have worse symptoms in the future. I mean, given the circumstances, I could be having worse effects because of the pandemic and once the pandemic is over my depression could not be as bad as it is now and I wouldn't need as much (if any) medicine anymore.

So I guess for now I'll just have to find some healing crystals that will magically take my depression away.  Either that or I will have worsening depression throughout my life as it gets more difficult to function every day until eventually I overwhelm myself to the point of not existing. If only it were that easy."

I‚Äôm inarticulate when I used to be well spoken.

I don‚Äôt have opinions on certain topics. I can‚Äòt find anything to talk about in conversations. I can‚Äòt follow conversations because I just can‚Äòt focus.

For the same reason I just can‚Äòt focus in uni online classes. I‚Äòm present all time but I don‚Äòt remember what the docent said two seconds ago and so after classes I leave without remembering anything from it. You can imagine how this makes university and life even harder for a person that already suffers from depression and social anxiety.

Often I don‚Äòt remember what I read in books or texts, what happened in a movie I watched, what I talked about with someone, what I experienced last day/week/month and so on.

I feel like I can‚Äôt even think anymore... like my mind is empty. I feel like I don‚Äôt know ANYTHING. It‚Äôs like I forgot everything I‚Äôve ever learned or experienced.

I start to skip classes more often because of this adding up to my depression and social anxiety. It‚Äòs just so incredibly hard focussing and understanding. This really fucks with my self worth and self esteem. I mean being socially anxious (not talkative, not open, asocial), depressive (low mood/anhedonic) and then dumb, too?

My brain turned completely empty, unable to function and dumb in the last time. It seems like I can‚Äòt access my head, thoughts, knowledge or memories. I have no concentration and memory, I can‚Äòt learn new things anymore. I read things I‚Äôm interested in and and then I forget them. And seriously how could someone develop not being able to learn?

I‚Äòm not sure if I‚Äòm able to complete my last two semesters of my psychology bachelor being like this. Even if I would complete it, I don‚Äòt know in which job someone like me, a young man with depression, social anxiety and now also cognitive deficits, could work and get his job well done. Then how would I ever be able to socialize when now even my cognition lets me down. How would soneone like me ever be happy and confident or create real friendships/romantic relationships? These thoughts worsen my depression but it‚Äòs so realistic when I stay like this, disabled.

I think having depression and anxiety for many years is the cause of my cognitive deficiency. Does/did anyone here experience similar? How can I demolish those problems? They really took the last ability I had in life as depression and social anxiety took the others..."

I don‚Äôt want to be alive. I don‚Äôt want to have to work everyday for the rest of my miserable life. I don‚Äôt want to have kids or meet anyone. I just want to be alone but at the same time not be so lonely. I just want to sleep. The only thing I really like is sleep. I wish I could just sleep forever. 

So what‚Äôs the point of it all? There‚Äôs really no reason for me to live is there?"
2553,depression,"Once again, nothing feels okay",I want to vanish into thin air.
2554,depression,struggling with codependency,"I've had depression for a long time now and I recently noticed my codependency has been one of the reasons why I am depressed. When I used to date my ex I was heavily codependent. My bad days would form whenever I knew I wasn't able to see him, or when he told me he was going to hangout with his friends, or when I felt like I wasn't getting enough attention. I knew that this was toxic for our relationship but I don't think he ever realized it. 

Fast forward to now, I am talking to another guy and I noticed I've become codependent with him as well. Except this time it's worse. The guy I am talking to struggles with depression as well, and whenever he was having a bad day, I would end up having a bad day too. When he's sad he tends to shut off his phone. So I would then spend the entire day being sad and worrying about him and worrying if I'm good enough for him. This is damaging to me since whenever I'm sad, I end up losing all productivity and motivation. Hence why my room gets cluttered all the time and I have lots of missing assignments. Recently he told me that he wanted to stop facetiming and going to sleep every night like we usually do and that broke me. I tried to keep a smile and told him that it's okay and that I respect his decision. However I know every night from now on will be like hell for me. I feel like I should end things with this guy but I like him way too much and I'm not sure if it's just my self destruction convincing me to do so. Plus, I heavily struggle with communication. I never ever say what's on my mind."
2555,depression,I'm holding my girlfriend hostage,"My very existence is a burden to her. She constantly says we don't belong together. She says she isnt confident in me. She says she doesnt trust me. She wants to break up but every time I fight and beg for her to stay because I love her and want her to be happy. She isn't excited by me anymore, not happy to see me, doesn't ask how I'm doing. Whenever I compliment her and tell her how much I appreciate her she just ignores me. I'm just the clutter of trash she doesn't feel like throwing out. I'm nothing to the woman I love. I'm barely even a person anymore. I'd be doing her a favor with offing myself. I'll always be by her side as long as she allows me to because I love her so much but I just wish I felt like she cared a bit more."
2556,depression,What moments of your life did you feel truly happy?,"When I went with my Dad to my Grandparent's house for Christmas  in Atlanta and played with my cousins when we were young. It was such an incredible feeling, they say heroin feels like that. First time I feel in love was also like that but it didn't last more than a few weeks."
2557,depression,Depression and the ability to act compassionate,"Do  you also feel less capable of being compassionate, especially on bad days? Do you feel more rigid with your boundaries and less understanding for others? Especially in the work enviroment, do you stay in the job  definition or do you go for extra mile?

I  find myself more unwilling to bend the rules or to use my spare time for the patients who have arrived just at the end of clinic hours, travelled form a different city, can't get away from work to come to the hospital or have trouble getting an appointment from hospital system. Increasingly, the reasons they give sound more like excuses. I still maintain my professionalism and act according to good medical practice but don't take on other people's job or use my own time to give extra care.

Am I turning into a heartless asshole or do you guys have a similar experience?"
2558,depression,If my sister gets a therapist I‚Äôm done.,"I don‚Äôt hate my family, I‚Äôm just a little frustrated right now, so I need to vent.

My sister who is year 10 captain, has perfect grades,  a large friend group and happy relationships, could be getting a therapist, we are twins, though she has been favourited for all my life, now after she broke up with her boyfriend of 1.5 weeks, she was a little sad, so my parents might be getting a therapist for her. Meanwhile I‚Äôm struggling with self harm (which they know about), depression, anxiety and hearing voices, hasn‚Äôt ever been asked if I‚Äôm ok, or gotten a hug. I have no friends and have barely talked to anyone but my family for 7 months, I sleep all day, and have been bullied. Yet my sisters is getting new phones, and love from my family and her friends. I am also aware that my parents are hiding a mental disorder from me.

I‚Äôm sorry if I sound mean I‚Äôm just a little upset today, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get better."
2559,depression,about to graduate - am I suppose to work until I die now?,"Graduating in 2 months with a business degree. I'm 21 and recently quit my retail job because I was mentally drained, had no motivation and just did the bare minimum; that was only 25 hours a week maximum. 

I feel like my mental health has reached it's lowest point right now. I've noticed that recently

* Zoning out during group outings
* Barely contribute to conversations and not talking
* Feeling depressed while with friends
* Bottling up my emotions all the time and never told my feelings to anyone
* Relying on alcohol to escape my emotions and reality
* Self-confidence is at an all time low
* Disengaged in daily activities/hobbies - not interested
* Can't even watch netflix or youtube without dozing off about my future
* I've just been listening to music and daydreaming for hours

I don't see myself working a full time job for the rest of my life, what am I saving up for? I have no intentions of buying a house. Am I suppose to look forward to the weekend each week, as a repeating cycle?"
2560,depression,I'm constantly being used as a therapist,"For some reason, I always attract the people who do nothing but complain, which is beginning to drain the LIFE out of me. I'm recovering from depression, so I guess I sympathise with everyone, but at this point no one asks me how I'm even doing, and my friends only talk to me when something's wrong. I wouldn't mind giving advice or anything but they suffer from mental illnesses and idk how to cure them. Bear in mind I'm 15 and I shouldn't have to carry everyone's trauma, especially that I want to focus on school but I literally would feel so bad to ignore my friends when they want to complain, so I'm constantly spending hours on my phone writing paragraphs trying to make them feel better which really does nothing.

I've previously cut off friends in the past and explained to them how used and drained I felt, and they made me feel like I'm the most evil person for doing it so I don't wanna hurt another person again.

Advice please? sorry this isn't related"

2572,depression,The Pressure is getting to me.,"Hi,
Firstly I would like to introduce myself, my name is A. I am 18 years old. I am a student and I am off to college. I have recently completed high school. So this was a basic introduction to myself and now I will tell how i am feeling right now and how all this pressure started to build up. I will let you know the phases I went through. You can skip a few phases but the final one is the most important one. I am just introducing the phases, you can skip them, later I will let you know how these phases are affecting me now mentally. I have put border around the phases so that you can skip them. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
THE BEGINNING:
The biggest concern in my life is my worry of my FUTURE. 
This first started when I was 14 and in high school (9th Grade). I wasn't a great student but I was always on the average side. Even though I was average, I was sincere and did all my work, tasks and other things properly. I was only average on the marks side. I did not score well. I was getting worried and marks were dropping every time. There were some subjects i like and I scored well in them but in some I was average and I failed in Mathematics (I passed in retest/compartment).


NEXT YEAR:
Then came Grade 10th of High school, I was doing great, I improved and I wanted to improve even more. I started scoring more, I started scoring above Average at that time. Everything was fine and smooth in Grade 10. It was great. Until the finals came. I did fairly well and I scored average. I score 72%. But this wasn't enough, I wanted to take Mathematics&amp;Physics as I wanted (even now this is my dream) to do do engineering. I am passionate about cars and I can make good designs and I have good knowledge about them on the technical side, I wanted to do automobile engineering. But the cutoff for this stream was 75%.
I was in top school of the city, they denied me because of 3%. My father was trying so hard to get my admission. The school told us to wait till August. We waited and the new session already begun. The admission was denied. I could have got the admission, if I tried hard enough myself. I could've persuaded the school by showing my capabilities, skills and my improvement. But I did not. This thing still eats me to this day. There is no night that I don't think about this phase. Every goddamn night. 


BIG CHANGE:
I took admission in some school in my city, not the best but an average school. I took mathematics. Mostly people who take the Science Streams take admissions in dummy schools. This was a dummy school (this means that attendance doesn't matter, children prepare for the big exam, the entrance exam. World's toughest exam, you can research about this). 
When I joined half of the year was gone because of me trying to get admission. 
When I joined, it was a shocking experience for me, my country's incompetent education system doesn't handle transitions well from Grade 10 to Grade 11. The syllabus was different and hard. It was complex. I mean it change so much, my progress was gone and I went below average and close to failing. Physics was the toughest for me. I failed in Mathematics and Physics in Grade 11 but somehow I managed to pass, in retest. 


FINAL PHASE OF HIGH SCHOOL AND THE PHASE OF PAIN:
Then came the final year of High school, grade 12. I had to do well to get admission in a good college. I tried understanding and keeping up with everything that I missed or that was going on in my syllabus. I joined coaching to help me understand. I understood most of the things, but there were some things left that would harm me later. But I was out of time. The whole year went by so fast, so quickly. I was frustrated by the end of it. My life became depressing. I did not do anything. My routine was HOME&gt;SCHOOL&gt;COACHING. That's it, thay was my routine from oast 2 years. I did not enjoy or do anything. 
Then by the end of the year Final exams came. I scored average in entrance exam. Then came the final exams. Same case, physics was tough for everyone, an I was sure I was about to fail. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


Now I will tell you how these things have affected me in the past 8 months during lockdown and Covid‚Äî19

As soon as my exams finished, within two weeks, the government imposed a lockdown in the country. Millions became homeless, people were struggling financially. This made me sad, only if i could do anything. This was not the proper way to impose a lockdown. Anyways, coming to the point, I felt relieved at the starting of Lockdown, I felt like it was a much needed break for me. 
Maybe I was happy that the result will be delayed or stuff or maybe I was happy and grateful for this break in life. I don't know. I did everything I wanted or I wanted to try, I did everything freely. I had no tension. 


But some days later, a feeling came rushing down in me. I became scared and anxious. I started to worry about my future. I started to worry about failure and disappointment. 
Few months later, the result date was announced, I was certain that I was going to fail, I started figuring out all the possibilities. I decided to end my life if I failed. As i couldn't bear the fact that I will disappoint my parents and I can't let them feel embarrassed. I started counting the days till the result. I started writing, doing everything i could. I started preparing and researching ways to die a peaceful death. 
I started to spend the time I had left with quality. This quality time was spent with my family. There was no night that I didn't cry.

Then came the result, somehow i managed to pass, but it was still a failure in my eyes. My parents were kind of happy but I could feel thay they are disappointed. I was disappointed in myself and my abilities. I started questioning my decisions. I was so close to death. I thought the pain will go away but clearly it did not, it became worse. Even though I managed to pass, but the marks were still average and I can't get into a good top level college to achieve my dream and the career path i am passionate about.

My life has become hell. I am the problem. I have got everything anyone could desire. I have got great height (6'3""),good body built, opportunities, facilities.
The one thing I have always sought is Perfection, i wanted perfection in everything. I hate failure and I always take it bad on me if I fail or disappoint anyone myself. I feel like an utter failure and disappointment to ny parents. I feel like a liability. I don't want to be a burden on them. We are a middle class family and they have done so much for me and spent so much on my education. Yet here I am. Honestly, i am in the most confusing phase of my life. I don't know what to do. Sometimes I feel like I should live and sometimes I only see death. Honestly, i feek like death is the better option. Instead of being a failure and disappointment to my parents I should just go. My siblings are doing good. I ahve always wanted the best for everyone. And i want the best for them also. Maybe seeking too much perfection is bad after all. I do not blame anyone but myself. I am a bad son.

Don't worry I won't die, I hope i find my path and i do well. No more mistakes this time. I hope i get my way. Because u just don't know what the hell is happening in my life. And if death comes, i hope so, it should be natural.

Farewell."
2573,depression,Have anyone here been so depressed that they were nauseous?,"I feel this today and it hate it.

Also contacted my therapist but she hasn't answered me for 3 days."
2574,depression,Antidepressants?,"Hey, so I feel it‚Äôs important to mention that I am not diagnosed with depression, however I deeply relate to all of its symptoms. I started struggling with low moods towards the end of high school, I would go a few days laying in bed with no interest in any of the things I used to have interest in, basically no energy. But after about maybe 3 days to a week of that, I would get a random burst of energy. I would get so much done all within a day usually like, deep cleaning my home, finishing hw, starting projects, taking a shower, etc. Being a functioning human being lol... Well now it‚Äôs gotten a lot worse, I don‚Äôt even get those bursts of energy anymore. It‚Äôs extreme lows every single day. And it‚Äôs been that way ever since my dad passed away last year in September. I know his passing is the main reason I‚Äôm like this now, but I can‚Äôt get out of this funk. I don‚Äôt have any motivation at all, I don‚Äôt have any energy. And I don‚Äôt want to be like this anymore. I know there is talk therapy, but I don‚Äôt feel like that will be of any help for me personally. And I honestly believe depression is what I am struggling with and what I have struggled with in the past. So I want to look into getting on antidepressants maybe, ofc after seeing a professional and if that‚Äôs even what I have. But how would I go about that? And if you don‚Äôt mind me asking, if anyone in this group is on or has taken antidepressants. Did they help you? How did they make you feel?"
2575,depression,I just cant anymore,"For ten years i kept myself strong, for myself and for everyone, in a relationship that sucked my life from me, i don‚Äôt recognize myself, i don‚Äôt have a will to live anymore, there‚Äôs no point. My body feels like a heavy sac of garbage. I want to open up to someone close to me but no one gives a shit, they laugh at my face, telling me that i‚Äôm not rational. 
I feel stuck and i‚Äôm tired."
2576,depression,Just want to escape from everything and everyone,"I'm a 31 years old guy with a decent software job. I've not been in a relationship since last 6 years and it was a pretty bas breakup. I haven't still come out of it mentally. I cut contact with literally all my friends and was left with no one. 

All I want is to settle down with a girl and live peacefully. But apparently it's not so easy. I have no one to share my feelings. I've got no friends (thanks to the breakup). My family doesn't understand and I'm fucking annoyed all the time. I have no good reason to live. I just want to sleep peacefully and never wake up. Every fucking day is a hell for me. 

I'm not sure how long I can hold it."
2577,depression,I can feel myself getting really low again,"I just wanna rant, this may make me feel less alone than writing stuff down.
The downwards spiral started at the beginning of last month when my ex of four years (first two years perfect, last two on and off) broke up with me. I started drinking, heavily. I went on a bender for eight days, drinking nothing but gin. I did learn a lot on the bender to be honest, I got closer to a lot of people in my life, I felt like I understood myself a lot more.
My ex got a new girlfriend a week later. It was a girl he was speaking to while we were on a break. She‚Äôs really ugly so it doesn‚Äôt make me feel as bad but it still hurts that he probably never liked me while we were together. He‚Äôd have been happy with any girl.
And I just feel so lost. I feel confused. About my sexuality. And I don‚Äôt know where to begin with that nor do I really wanna think about it. But when I don‚Äôt think about it, intrusive thought come. Dreams come telling me I‚Äôm actually gay. And I don‚Äôt know what I am honestly. I‚Äôm probably just bi but I‚Äôve just been trying to conceal that part of myself for a long time for various reasons, mainly being that I don‚Äôt feel safe or comfortable to be anything other than straight due to past experiences. I don‚Äôt wanna live a lie but I don‚Äôt wanna live the truth. I don‚Äôt know what I wanna do. I just wanna be happy.
I‚Äôve been having major issues with the way I look. They‚Äôve always been there, just recently it‚Äôs been overly magnified to me. I know why I have these issues, and whenever I look at my body in the mirror I feel physically sick and just want to cry. I just want to put on weight, I feel like I have the body of a child and it makes me pretty suicidal honestly especially knowing that I can try my best to eat as much food as I can but nothing ever changes. I‚Äôm never gonna be anything other than skinny and I‚Äôm fucking sick of looking the way I do. 
My course is stressing me out, having to do more work than previous years this year and with my focus being so bad it takes up so much of my time. Making me feel more shitty.
I‚Äôve started cutting everyone off. After my breakup I got so close to everyone in my life again since my ex didn‚Äôt like me having friends. I even started to develop new friendships. But I‚Äôve been ignoring everyone for days because my mental health is too poor and I know that these people will understand if they‚Äôre the right people but I just feel so shitty for letting people down. 
I just feel like I‚Äôm here sometimes. Like I‚Äôm invisible to everyone else if that makes sense. Like I‚Äôd be in a room and it‚Äôd be like I‚Äôm watching it from a tv show and I‚Äôm not in the room... I just feel like I don‚Äôt exist sometimes and that can make it harder to socialize. I think this is due to depression, anxiety and being so confused about my sexuality that it fucks with my mind and makes me wonder who I am on a daily basis. 
I really don‚Äôt know how much longer I can cope with feeling so confused. But also all of my issues, especially around my appearance. I feel like I will never be able to be naked in front of a mirror, let alone around another person and it scares me. I don‚Äôt wanna be so insecure about the way I look. I love who I am and my personality I wish my body aligned with that. 
I‚Äôve been getting suicidal thoughts. They‚Äôre intrusive. I do love life, I love being alive, I know that sometimes I just go through shit but it isn‚Äôt life that‚Äôs the issue. But I‚Äôm afraid one day I‚Äôll get drunk or just dissociate really hard and end up getting the balls to fucking kill myself. I don‚Äôt wanna go out like that. But I‚Äôm afraid."

2580,depression,Hello?,"Hi. I‚Äôve never done this before so forgive me. 
I don‚Äôt remember the last time I was genuinely happy. My father died when I was 8, I‚Äôm now 29 &amp; I honestly never thought I‚Äôd make it past 16. I‚Äôm in constant pain &amp; just want to be with my father tbh. I can‚Äôt sit/stand/lay down/walk without being in pain. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can do this for. I think about all the ways to end it but I just couldn‚Äôt bare the thought of my family finding me. I‚Äôm so tired."
2581,depression,I‚Äôm officially one month sober!,After struggling with self harm in so many ways- I‚Äôm finally a month sober from everything. I literally couldn‚Äôt be happier and I actually want to cry right now because I did not think I‚Äôd make it this far.
2582,depression,I tried,"Past few months my mood has hit rock bottom. I‚Äôve attempted to hang myself only to have my boyfriend stop me, and I almost jumped off a building but I was too afraid to. I think this is a sign that maybe I do want to live, but I keep cycling in and out of it. I do want to die but I think I‚Äôm just afraid of pain. People tell me how much they care and how much they love me but I don‚Äôt trust it."
2583,depression,I'm scared.,Don't really know why I wrote this. I had to just to keep myself occupied. I feel I am losing touch with reality. And it scares the hell out of me. Maybe I'm about to reach my breaking point.
2584,depression,Struggling to manage my mental health,"A little over a year ago my mother was unexpectedly diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, things are now getting worse, fast.

It pains me to see her in such a state of struggle, and I'm finding my mental health quickly declining. I'm struggling to find reason to get up in the morning, and I don't know what I will do when I lose her.

I have a younger sister who I need to be around for, but it hurts so much to be alive. I have no intentions of self harming, but I find myself either tryimg.to find a meaning to life or thinking about the end all the time. 

I have a lot of people who love and support me, but it just doesn't seem to be cutting it. I've been experiencing anxiety attacks for the first time in my life, and I have strong chest pains just about all day. 

Any coping mechanisms or advice would be appreciated."
2585,depression,getting older is so scary,"every time i think about being alive past 18 and having to be an adult it stresses me out so much. i know ill never be able to be an adult. ill never be able to live a normal life, i just hope i can be dead before then. hopefully before 2021 if all goes well :/"

2587,depression,I‚Äôm just stuck...,"(Day 2 of posting)

I feel so stuck, even if I could work up the courage to ask for help nobody would listen. Everyone in my house is constantly shutting me down, I can‚Äôt even talk. The only reason I even use my voice at all is just to talk to myself. 

Besides, even if I did it‚Äôs not like I hadn‚Äôt tried before. When I was 7, after a solid 2 years after beginning to absolutely hate myself, I asked for help. I was just pushed away, I had the phrase ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt depressed, kids don‚Äôt get depressed.‚Äù thrown at me.

What do you think, should I try again? Should I open my heart to my own parents just to get it shattered again?"
2588,depression,Help for a friend who's depressed(SERIOUS),"Sorry english is not my primary language :(

My friend 35(F) is severely depressed and and at times she's a bit suicidal.

To begin with she's a victim of physical, mental and emotional abuse starting in her late teens, kicked from home when she was 16 survived on her own by doing medium wage jobs, working late, pull in favours. There's no parental love, no partner/spouse/boyfriend in her life. She used to have boyfriends but they either cheated or abused her. She has no degree/diploma to her name, wants to study law (wants to be a human right activist or some sort of environmentalist) but realising that it will take 5 years and will cost a lot of money &amp; she will be in her 40s by the end of it  plus the fact that young people are always preferred first in job applications. That idea is also losing it's value. Every time i tell her to study for it she gets emotional and starts crying because this opportunity was denied to her in her 20s and the trauma that comes from thinking about it. For the past 4-5 yrs she has been living with her parents after not seeing them for more than a decade there's almost always fights and arguments which end with her crying to bed because she feels like her life is done and everything's over. 

I don't know what comforting words i could possibly say to save her every day feels like a spiral and a loop."

2593,depression,I wish everyone hated me so I could have a reason to kill myself.,"but they don‚Äôt. I tried so hard to push people away and isolate myself because they are the last real obstacle in my way, but instead they all came together to talk about how much they ‚Äòcared about me.‚Äô This is not what I wanted. I wanted everyone to hate me so they would be happy when I was gone. why can‚Äôt they just let me have this? Why can‚Äôt they just let me leave? I fucking hate everyone and everything...but I hate myself most of all. Everything that‚Äôs wrong in my life is because of me, but I‚Äôd rather die like a pathetic piece of human garbage than fix it all because I‚Äôm literal trash. I‚Äôm trash. Fuck everything."
2594,depression,Is it possible to be content?,"I often catch myself repeating negative phrases about myself, like ""I'm a piece of shit, I want to die"" etc. But sometimes, those are more conditional phrases, ""someday, I'll be happy."" ""If I do X and Y, I'll be happy"" but I'm afraid that even if X and Y do happen, I'll be waiting for Z.

Is contentment an illusion? Is it even possible to be a generally happy person?"
2595,depression,Is there something wrong with me that makes me unlikeable?,"Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm even thought of by other people, do they think about me as much as I think about them. Do they think about me and then exclude me or do just not think about me at all? Like am I a thought in their head when their choosing who to invite to parties, who to drink with, who to hang out with.

I‚Äôve heard so many empty promises from my friends ‚Äúbro you don‚Äôt get out enough I‚Äôll invite u over sometime‚Äù ‚Äúoh you‚Äôve never been to a party I‚Äôll invite you to one‚Äù. I mean the opportunity has come up several times, and I know you‚Äôre doin what you said you‚Äôd do with me just without me. 

Maybe they think I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy parties and alcohol because I haven‚Äôt done any of that shit before, so they exclude me purposely because they think I‚Äôd have more fun that way, despite showing interest on several occasions.

I just can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm unlikeable because I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm not on several times but also I never get invited to anything, and sometimes it‚Äôs rubbed in my face that I‚Äôm excluded all the time.

Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking"

2598,depression,I dont have anyone,"My only friend online doesn't want to talk to me anymore. They're running out of compassion and they just can't deal with it anymore so they're cutting me off. I don't blame them. I try to keep my issues and emotions to myself as much as I can but it was still too much. I tried to beg and grovel for them to stay but it wasn't enough. 

They meant a lot to me and now they gone for good, just like that. No closure.

2599,depression,I‚Äôd prefer to bear the pain everyone faces,"I sit here writing this, and it‚Äôs not a suicide note... surprisingly. That was supposed to be last week.

Lord willing I would, but I absolutely cannot... not because I don‚Äôt want to, but everything to do with I can‚Äôt choose what you do. All I can help with is taking the hurt and pain I feel and try to facilitate to the best of my ability a way for me to make it more clear to you that living depressed is a lot better than not living at all.
I write this on a not so great night, from a dark and melodic place where the harmonies of depression bounce around.... constantly singing their tunes of sorrow in my head. 
My one wish in this lifetime... to be allowed to take your pain away. Take whatever has hurt you and wear it myself like a plate of armor. I wish to the god, gods, universe, I could take what you have for myself and leave you free to live. Most would say you wouldn‚Äôt truly take that. The thing is I undoubtedly would, no questions asked. I cried tonight not from my own depression, but from reading all your posts on this sub and realizing how widespread depression is. I want you to be GOOD. I want you to LIVE. I want you to have a FAMILY. I want you HAPPY. I don‚Äôt need to know you because I already do, we‚Äôre all the same. 
I wish I didn‚Äôt have to lean half my body over a bridge last week, just to feel like I was finally alive. But in an instant if I had a chance.... just know I would choose to bear the pain of the world, and suffer myself so that you could all lead beautiful lives. That would make me feel more whole than anything else in this world could.
I have nothing but love for all of you ‚ù§Ô∏è 
My hope in you reading this is you realize I don‚Äôt need to know you for you to feel like I care. My tears from commenting on ‚Äòstrangers‚Äô posts to try and help should suffice as enough evidence. It kills me to know how many of your are hurting. I wish upon no one. And I only wish I could take it for you.
Please, even on your worst day, do not take that last breath from your own hand. Fight with me. Live with me. Grow with me. And I can promise you, you will realize if you keep going that you are worth more than the universe holds. You are unique, special, goofy, most importantly loved. DONT YOU EVER FUCKING DO IT."
2600,depression,I want to support you,"Im batteling depression, have been for 5 years, monthly therepy sessions... but some days nothing helps, and suicidal thoughts are the second worst, worst is homisidal thoughts about my children...

Some days i just want to leave everything and start again... no one know this side of me, even my wife just knows im depressed, she has no idea how far dowm this rabbit hole goes...

I find talking to people who understand is a powerful tool, to actually be acknoledged, it helps alot.

If youre ever at the edge reach out to a stranger, its alot easier than showing this to people who know you, also you never have to talk to that person again if you dont want to...

2604,depression,My father finally accepts that I have the big sad.,"After hiding my growing depression and anxiety till I was 18 and technically not my parents problem it took only two more years to tell my mom how unbearably sad I am for no reason. She accepted it very quickly but my father has been telling me ‚Äúdepression is like the flu you‚Äôll get over it eventually‚Äù all my life till I realized that I am in it for the long haul all the way to the grave because as a catholic I am too fearful to off myself (my mother is happy to hear that). Three nights ago after talking to my father in person, he went hope and told my mother ‚Äúso she‚Äôs sick..‚Äù apparently sounding so lost. Of course he went through the stages of grief and questioned whether he took part. (A bit but overall a good father and would absolutely devastated if I said he contributed in comparison to my mother who will take what I say and accept it with a ‚Äúwho cares‚Äù attitude‚Äù). I am joining this sub officially today and literally they are the only two people in my life who I believe care about as I have absolutely devastated myself because I am incapable of maintaining  any relationship. Texting gives me so much anxiety and I let messages sit and then time just passes and I open it or don‚Äôt reply. Well that‚Äôs the tip of the ice berg but at least my father will finally accept this part of me. It feels okay to be seen I guess."
2605,depression,"I can't live with this thought, I feel sick."," During last summer, I developed a sense of high anxiety around being in the company of young people/babies that I'd never had prior. This was a result of feeling intense distress over finding out that an ex teacher was a pedophile. I came to realize in March this year through research that this is called POCD, which provided me with a lot of relief.

In the late evening of Monday, 23rd September 2019 after having moved back into university halls of residence for my second year a week prior, I basically watched pornography for around about 2-4 hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height. I'd already experienced false memories by this point.

Anyway, for that whole afternoon and night, I would go from grinding/humping against the bed (an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens) while watching Porn Hub on my phone, to then sitting up and watching random videos on YouTube.

The second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his 2 year old daughter, that appeared on the homepage after going back from Porn Hub and sitting up in bed again. At this point, I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video, I shouldn't watch another video afterwards, purely ''because this YouTube video had a baby in it'' - even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone, not to mention obviously by content. Nevertheless, I watched the interview video, scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to Porn Hub, and only then did I kneel down to grind the duvet again, but with a video loaded.

Finally, I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain's daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having watched the prior porn. The reason for this is that - as best as I can describe - seeing her (as a baby, the pinnacle of innocence) exemplified the essential humanity that we all have, including the adult performers. As a result, I felt heavy guilt (that I now realize to be misplaced) for being what I considered to be ''anti-feminist'', and an ''evil person''.

Perhaps I overthink the morality of things, I don't know.

My brain at the time immediately started to go into overload and overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of watching YouTube then lewd stuff. I remember going to the sink afterwards, and dry-vomiting.

With regards to the actual first-person recollection of possibly staring at the Cobain video, I have no explicit sensory memory of this. The 'image' in my head is grainy at best. I wouldn't have been able to live with myself were this the opposite.

After leaving the bathroom and panicking a lot, I walked through it step-by-step, and eventually felt comfortable enough that I hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong and so I left it. This, as a general worry didn't reappear again till May 2020, with the rest of 2019 being spent going from day-to-day worries and false memories. I even felt happy and content on New Year's Day this year.

Surely, if I'd done this horrible thing, I wouldn't have been able to feel anything happy ever again?

At first, I wondered if I did do it, and I just repressed it, or I didn‚Äôt and actually it‚Äôs just my overactive imagination mixed with my anxiety. I know that in my heart I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, as I had listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards, and didn‚Äôt feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I would‚Äôve if I‚Äôd done anything wrong.

Things have gotten better mildly. My first appointment with an OCD therapist is soon. I'm currently on the fourth day of taking a beta-blocker to regulate my heart-rate and blood pressure that helps ward off the panic attacks I have about it. I'm trying to sleep better, but sometimes the image creeps in too much. I'm due to get a new set of the anti-depressant mirtazipine soon, too.

But even with that, it all feels like too much right now and I'm more suicidal than ever about this. I don't want to die over an image in my head, but is this a belated guilty conscience? I feel sick and can't think or sleep. I have moments of 'you know you're being silly, start living again', but then it hits my head over and and I end up in bed depressed for another week.

I worry that I might, out of a morbid curiosity, have done it. I remember faintly thinking how awful it would be to do it, and then - as far as I know - not doing it."

2607,depression,My biggest insecurity is being second choice.,"It always has been. And I‚Äôve always been exactly that. I always try to put my friend‚Äôs happiness over mine, but in the end I will still be the partner-less one when there‚Äôs an odd number of people at an amusement park, I will still be the one who is only invited because someone else dropped out last minute, I will still be the third best friend, the one who walks behind them when there‚Äôs no room on the sidewalk, I will still be the person who no one checks up on unless I reach out first, I will still be the person who gives and gives and I don‚Äôt expect much but a damn ‚ÄúHow are you doing?‚Äù once in a while when you asked and I told you I was suicidal again would suffice.

I‚Äôm just asking for once, I want to be someone‚Äôs first choice. I want to someone to reach out first. I want someone to care about how I‚Äôm doing and mean it.

All my life, even after my diagnosis, they all said I was suicidal for attention. Is that so wrong that I want someone to at least care a little bit? Is it so wrong that I‚Äôm still clinging to the last bit of hope that someone, just one person, would care enough if I was gone? 

In the end, everyone will have someone if I‚Äôm gone. They won‚Äôt be partner-less at the amusement park, they won‚Äôt walk behind one another but besides one another on the sidewalks, they will have people to check up on them if they‚Äôre sad, if they were drowning they‚Äôd have a hand to lift them up. I‚Äôm not needed. I‚Äôm only, ever will be, the second choice."

I was serious but hopeful I‚Äôm 5 days from my first day of sophomore year. I‚Äôve lost some weight gained some good friends and have a proper support system. I was righting this because I was gonna consider honoring my promise to myself but though I‚Äôm nowhere near where I want to be I‚Äôm no longer that boy. that being said give yourself time to grow don‚Äôt be hard on yourself just live let the river of life sweep you in its currents and take you to your next destination in life.

I wish I could care, I really do. I‚Äôm tired of half-assing things and I‚Äôve turned into a lazy person. It‚Äôs probably going to make me fall behind but there‚Äôs nothing that feels worth pushing forward for.

2614,depression,I wish I would have the strength to reach out (again),"Around this time last year I changed schools, I didn‚Äôt even manage to attend the first lesson because of my anxiety disorder.

I also told my friends about it and they were fairly supportive but it seems like everyone forgot and I‚Äôm way too afraid to bring it up when I feel down. Ok two of them definitely did not forget but every time someone brings it up I get really defensive or try to deflect, even though I would love to talk about my problems. I also never find the right words or know what to say, even if I could find the right words, what would be the point in talking? I‚Äôm most likely won‚Äôt change, I can tell myself three billion times that I will seek help or try something but in the end I probably won‚Äôt because I couldn‚Äôt find the strength because I think that everything is already hopeless. It‚Äôs a never ending cicle and I wish could break it somehow."
2615,depression,[19F] I've messed up horrendously and I've absolutely no idea what to do.,"I knew as soon as I completed compulsory education that I didn't want to attend university. Having said that, I made the mistake of applying and of following through before the very last minute. Come August last year, I called up my choice, told them I was no longer interested, and told myself I'd get work experience under my belt.

Skip a year and here I am: still depressed, unemployed, suicidal, an anxious wreck. The list goes on. I'm terrible at functioning. The worst part is, I repeated my past mistake and decided to re-apply, thinking that if I tried hard enough to convince myself, I'd actually want to go, somehow persuading myself prospects would be better with a degree. At times it seemed all well and good ‚Äî independence from parents, socialising with new, different people, joining societies etc, etc. But, yet again, just two weeks before I'm supposed to be going, I've suffered a massive nervous breakdown and have admitted to my mum that despite everything I'd already invested, I don't want to go. Needless to say, I've disappointed her, and rightly so. 

And I don't. Genuinely. But somewhere in my mind, and I apologise for how obnoxious this may sound, I've got this idea stuck that without a degree, I'm completely and utterly fucked ‚Äî and that I'll be spending the entirety of my life stuck in full-time minimum wage work. And for those who do it and love it, massive kudos to them ‚Äî but the thought of spending another sixty odd years just working full-time, it makes me want to die. Genuinely. 

Every time an opportunity comes along, I self-sabotage and I've absolutely no idea why. I become anxious and quit before I've the chance to either try it or get used to it. I'm not saying this in regards to university, but anything. And I keep catastrophising that I'll be 26-years-old and still living with my parents, still unemployed, and eventually they'll get sick of my shit and kick me out.

I just don't know what's wrong with me. I'm so incredibly scared. I'm stuck in a slump and it just keeps getting worse, and worse. I've absolutely no passion in anything whatsoever ‚Äî at least no passions I can turn into a career without a degree, damn it. I feel so dysfunctional. I've tried going to my GP multiple times but they've been of little help, ever. I've so many gaps in my CV that I doubt any hiring managers will want me. Plus, there's a whole damn pandemic out there, and we're on the brink of economic recession.

I genuinely struggle to see myself in five years' time. I feel so dumb, incapable, and inferior. I genuinely keep thinking about ending my life. I'll try to go to the doctors on Monday and sign on to receive unemployed payment, but that's all I can do for now. Pales in comparison to what my sisters have achieved. 

I'm such a damn failure."
2616,depression,Should I see a therapist again?,"
I [25F] have been diagnosed with depression, depersonalization/derealization in the past. I think I've been depressed most of my adult life but did not get diagnosed till I was 21. I took therapy for 1.5 years, was put on medication. It helped a great deal and I am off them since December 2019. 

Lately I have been under a lot of stress from work. To make it worse, I have been making a lot of mistakes and the quality of my work is suffering greatly (I am not sure it's because of the stress or I'm just not doing my bit properly). I have suicidal thoughts once in a while, especially after I fuck up my work. I have been depersonalized most of the time. I feel paranoid that someone is going to hack me to death (doesn't happen very often). 

But the worst part is that whenever I think of work I get extremely nervous. I have tingling sensation in my hands and feet. It's difficult getting out of the bed in the morning but I can't stay in bed either because my heart palpitations do not let me sleep. When I decided to take a week off work, I just couldn't relax and ended up working to avoid the tingling and palpitations. I cannot sleep till I tire myself out by watching/reading. 

I am certain that I have made it sound worse than it actually is. I don't feel depressed as much as I used to 2-3 years ago. Back then I wouldn't have been able to get out of bed, least do any kind of work. I am not sure if it's worth going to a therapist. I contacted my old therapist but she forgot to give an appointment, I guess. I am in my hometown for another month, so I'll have to discontinue meetings after I move back to where I work. 

Any advice?"

2618,depression,I can‚Äôt think of a good title,"I don‚Äôt really talk about my feelings that much so this is weird for me, but fuck it. All my life I‚Äôve been an isolated nerd that can‚Äôt muster a good conversation with anyone other than my immediate family or fellow outcasts. About three years ago in high school I met the most amazing girl ever. She reached out to me all the time and thought of me as a real friend. This was around the time that I seriously contemplated suicide and wrote up plans to go through with it, so this phase in my life came as a shock to me. The entire time that I knew her I was always super respectful as I usually am, but I always had an issue of showing no emotion or making any interesting conversation around her. The best way I could describe it is when you‚Äôre taking a history test and when you have to remember something but your mind is completely blank. I had this same experience for the 2 years that I‚Äôve known her. She was supposed to be so easy to talk to man. We had similar interests and hobbys in video games and our life goals. But I couldn‚Äôt even talk to somebody like her like a regular fucking person. I haven‚Äôt seen her since I graduated high school, and I thought to myself that there is more fish in the water, so I kept on trying to meet new people in college, but it was the same shit as before, no development of interesting conversation or many friendships. I honestly don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me, as I‚Äôve even tried losing weight to fix my social issues, but still nothing. The only option I really have now is blowing my fucking brains out cause I know I can‚Äôt be happy. Once I get my own place and after I secured my parents‚Äô future I‚Äôm gonna buy a shotgun and wait, since i cry myself to sleep at least 5/7 days a week so it‚Äôd only be a matter of time before I muster the courage to do it.

It just results in me getting hurt and them blocking me and refusing to bother with me thinking i'm a smart ass. I had to block a guy from another sub for doing this to me. Again, I got hurt out of it. A lot of folks have written me off as a lost cause and it just makes me even more sadder than I am.

I've contemplated waiting until the end of this year but I don't know if there is any justification for waiting that long. I am estranged from my family and living in a home by the grace of a roommate who resents me. I don't leave this room except to go shopping. My legs don't work as well as they used to. Nothing does. Life is hell. I regularly hope to die in my sleep."
2623,depression,Dad doesn‚Äôt care,My dad kept screaming at me today that the only reason I‚Äôm depressed is because I‚Äôm not doing normal teens things like going to school and then kept telling me all my issue is i worry about everyone else‚Äôs life white trying to explain to him that i was extremely unwell and mentally ill and have been in isolation for 4 yrs kept saying no it‚Äôs because your not in school .. and saying i don‚Äôt want to go outside and be with other teens because I‚Äôm not in school but it‚Äôs more of if I‚Äôm mentally ill and he won‚Äôt listen then i snapped and told him one tramatic experience that happened where i was drugged and sexually assaulted and that i told him this 2 yrs ago and he said no but i remember my mother being on the phone with his girlfriend bc i think she was shit talking me in messaging telling me there‚Äôs nothing wrong with me 2 yrs ago and then she said oh she remembered but ‚Äúi didn‚Äôt say i was drugged ‚Äú !??? So yeah what‚Äôs the fucking difference if i was drugged or not i also was sexually assaulted the year before that in school!! And she tried saying oh no i thought you were talking about while trying to save her ass when i know i didn‚Äôt talk about that incident when i snapped 2 yrs ago then told me my drugged up story wasn‚Äôt making sense the ‚Äúgf‚Äù... and kept asking me questions and told me omg why didn‚Äôt you tell anyone ??

2626,depression,"September, 05. 2020.","*Diary Entry: Rainy Days*

Woke up on Friday with suicidal thoughts. Had a nightmare on Thursday. Had anxiety last night. Woke up depressed on Wednesday. 

It‚Äôs Saturday and things are so... blurry. I wonder if there‚Äôs ever any end to my mental sufferings. I feel so lost in life, in my journey. I feel tired all the time. 

I‚Äôm really struggling with suicidal thoughts right now. I want to end my life, and not continue this endless self-disappointment, imperfection and struggles. These pointless fantasies of having a great life. Anxieties. These mini-heartbreaks. These resentment, anger and envy I don‚Äôt even know where to direct. 

Whatever I will do will not fit into the narrative I love and perfect picture continuation of the story. Whatever I do will disappoint me. I will continue being hit by life and myself, again and again.

So why can‚Äôt I just finish it?

How easy would it be. These thoughts are obsessively rolling in my head like old cinema tapes. I know life is all about misery but I can‚Äôt endure it. I am indeed really weak, not tough enough, I‚Äôm sensitive. I‚Äôm a snowflake. 

No matter how productively and perfectly I finish my schedule, I still get no satisfaction to its fullest. 

I don‚Äôt love myself, I bore myself. I think no man should love me either. There‚Äôs nothing good about me and if a man loved me, he‚Äôd be fooling himself. And how can I let my lover be dishonest to himself? It‚Äôs the best if I just die alone and not bother anyone, not even the nurses should bother with me. 

I want some peace of mind. 

I really envy people who just... exist. Have no thoughts, heavy ideas, have no crazy ambitions they can never realistically achieve that hurts them, have no anxieties, or a tyrannical figure in their heads telling them every single thing they do is not enough. 

Every time I think about suicide, I disappoint myself. I feel like all the growth and progress I‚Äôve made since my last suicide attempt with my mental health is lost. I feel like I betrayed myself again and again. 

Then, when I feel good, something in the back of my head tells me this happy moment doesn‚Äôt matter because I will have suicidal thoughts again. 

I have no friends. I feel so lonely.

I love to assume that I don‚Äôt have social circles because I‚Äôm quiet and introverted. 

Maybe at the end of the day I just have a really shitty personality that nobody wants to deal with. 

It‚Äôs honestly surprising how good I am at keeping my composure when I feel like breaking down and cry out loud in public. I always suck it up. I always carry myself elegantly, very calm, very ladylike, and wait until I get home. 

I really fucking despise myself. I hate the way I look, the way I sing, the way I dance, I hate the way my voice sounds, I hate my heavy ambitions, I hate my dreams that don‚Äôt let me live in peace, I hate the way I dress, I hate my habits. I hate the way food tastes. I hate the way my stomach rolls when I sit down. I hate the way my chin doubles when I lay down. I hate the way my eyes get puffy in the morning. 

Most importantly, I hate how complex I am. My personality, my thoughts, my mind, they are too hard to understand, too hard to analyze. It I was another person watching me from external world, I would never deal with me. Too much labour. Too much hard work. And joke‚Äôs on me for dreaming about a man I can bond with and call my soulmate. No person would ever want to deal with a woman whose mind is as heavy as an airport baggage. 

Honestly, if a car hit me, I would thank the driver.  I hope someone accidentally runs over me today. 

Oh, wait. I don‚Äôt even go outside my house anymore. No drunk drivers for me. 

I feel like there‚Äôs a big authoritarian, abusive tyrant in my head that makes me write those awful things about myself, the very tyrant that makes me do the greatest things in my life, overpushing myself, allowing me reach the perfection, the same tyrant that inspires me to do great art is the same tyrant that pushes me closer to suicide. If I didn‚Äôt have this tyrant, I‚Äôd be happy, but I would also be absolutely untalented. 

I understand Kanye West so much when he said when he takes his meds, he can‚Äôt be creative. When he said his mind is in genius mode when he‚Äôs depressed. 

I think artistic people are born to suffer. 

It‚Äôs not that artists do art, therefore suffer. It‚Äôs that those people suffer, they cope by doing art, then become masters in their craftsmanship, then become great artists as a consequence. 

Great artists suffered long time before their first artistic debuts. 

It is so tempting. If I had to describe my suicidal thoughts, it‚Äôd be like putting a cheesecake in front a of a girl who has been dieting for months. She knows she needs to stay on diet, she knows she should not give in, otherwise what‚Äôs the point of all of this? But it‚Äôs still so tempting and she salivates, because it would be something that relieves her. And it‚Äôs so painful to watch the cheesecake and hope that hunger will ease down a little bit. But once she gives in, the diet is over. Diet symbolizing life and the cheesecake being death. 

I am the starving girl on diet right now. 

If I had to describe my depressing thoughts, It would be ‚Äúsounds very irrational, but feels very convincing.‚Äù Because I know, I KNOW how irrational they are. I know they are probably not true. But it JUST feels convincing. Just like when you turn the lights off and feel like someone is staring at you from the darkness even though you KNOW there is nobody else in the room and you turn back the lights on from that convincingly scary feeling because it overpowers your rationality and logic, I feel the same way about suicide and depression. 

Sounds irrational, but feels convincing."
2627,depression,I just wish my father could‚Äôve shut the fuck up.,"My father did tell me that I was his little Princess and that I was beautiful growing up only to tell me that I was too fat or that I needed to straighten my teeth afterwards.

Because of that whenever anybody compliments me, I don‚Äôt believe it. I don‚Äôt think they actually mean it, because neither did my father.

I just wish he wouldn‚Äôt have even tried at all to be a good father to me. Because he fucking failed every time. I just wish he was never a part of my life. I wish he never spoke to me. I wish I never knew who he was. I wish he just died before I was born. I just hate him very very very very very much and because of my father I am the insecure, miserable and hopeless piece of shit I am today. Because of him. All because of him. I hate him."

2629,depression,Help! I'm seriously thinking of killing myself,"I can't do this anymore. It's too hard. My whole family hates me and blames me for everything.

I didn't study or work what i wanted, I have both physical and mental health problems, I have been used a lot by my friends and I have financial problems. I can't think anymore. It's just too hard and no one seem to want me here so why stay? I can't even get a professional help because my family thinks I'm an awful human being who doesn't deserve anything. I really can't keep up with what's happening to me. I have ptsd, depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, I oversleep to 16 hours sometimes and recently I have been feeling like I'm on autopilot (depersonalisation). I have been trying so hard but life isn't getting easier and it feel like breathing is rather a task and a chore."
2630,depression,I‚Äôm so alone,Everyday feels like a monotonous void. I want to be with someone so bad but I know my lack of confidence and quiet characteristics are holding me back. It‚Äôs the worst when you know you have no one to blame but yourself. I just wish things would get better.

I know I need to live, in order to be punished. But it's too much ai can't take this anymore. I Always compare those punishments to what have I done there's no punishment for my existence. I don't need to physically harm people of mentally harm them, just being next to them, existing by their sides is the worst thing someone could wish for. 
 I haven't eaten in 3 days, I am not planning on eating until I feel safe for eating food. I can't eat my mom's food, I can't eat my bought food, I can't drink water not even alcohol. I am crying I guess that speeds up the process of dehydration. I should have died a long time ago. My mother, won't let me see my friends until I clean all the house, I can't get out of my bed, what a pathetic failure I am. My Mom won't let me see him, but I solely exist to love him and I can't be close to him, why?... Why that's not fair... Any of this is not fair. I am tired of suffering, I can't do this anymore. 
I hate myself, I hate my family, oh god I should have never been born. What a burden I am. I should be dead. 
I don't have a father but he showed up last month because he saw me with my only reason to live. He went nuts. I don't understand, why?. Why whybwhywhywhywhywhyhwyhy. What the fuck have I done?! .. My mother won't approve him, my brother is 13  and acts like I am his property, he takes all the decisions about me. I am tired . If this is what being a girl is like I fucking hate it. I hate it. I should have been born with a dick maybe then I'd have the right to beat my sister, throw chairs around the house and insult my mom. Because I'm just a boy! Haha! Everyone wants me out of their way. 
Perfect. My life actually is perfect why am I overreacting. Obviously perfect. Perfect in every way. 
I'll lose myself and it's gonna be perfect, perfect. 
No more pain, no more bruises I won't know, I won't know. 
No more tears, I'll pull those eyes out that his left to cry with, perfect.
Love me I'll turn your love to endless lust, there's no way you're gonna leave me I've given you everything, You can't go. You can't make time for me. That's a waste. 
That's a fucking waste. Please, if I die. Just think you won't be spending more money on me.i never wanted you to buy me things why did you do that? 
I told you i didn't want clothes why did you buy me. Clothes. Now... Where are they gonna go?. 
If you wrap them around my dead self. They are gonna stain, all of your hard work will just end up with pretty stains.
I can't,  keep this.. Going.. Anymore.. 
I am. Officially done... I'll stop loving him. 
I'll stop seeing my friend... 
I'll stop talking stop eating and drinking water. 
Hopefully I'll stop breathing one day. 
Then I'll fix this world, by removing myself.

2635,depression,Last Thursday I decided to kill myself. [Trigger warning if you are suicide sensitive],"Do you wake up in your bed, thinking about ending your life?

Do you think about how it would be if you end this constant charade that you play with your life?

Do you feel not good sometimes?

Do you feel not good all the time?

Do you have to tire yourself to sleep?

Are you fidgety and restless?

I have a few answers to the aforesaid questions, but first let me close the doors of this dusty old attic so that no one walks in on me. I don‚Äôt want anyone to see me like this. This naked. This vulnerable. This empty. This hollow.

It smells of dust and old furniture herein the attic. It makes my nose itch, but this dark dusty old attic is the only place which lets me confide. It is the only place in house where I don‚Äôt suffocate.

As I write this I feel like I‚Äôm holding a mic on podium of a theater and staring at the empty faces of the audience. It haunts me. So I‚Äôll haunt them. I have decided however futile it seems I will go out there and speak.

If I think thoroughly about how loneliness has effected me. It helped me a lot when every time I was being told that I was not desired.

I joke about how hollow I have been.

For me vanity was like a pesky little sister of greed and runt of the desire. It filled me like a balloon is filled with air, only for some time and only to be hollow. It filled me just enough. But it always left me hollow. I kept sucking emptiness in this shell like a vacuum craving for void.

It was like cigarettes. I needed to burn another as soon as one ended.

I smoked my last cigarette by quarter past 01:00 at night. Smoking excessively throughout the day had made my head pound. At least it helped me not to feel empty, even if for a short while. I figured, it was ok if I burn and suffocate instead of feeling hollow and empty.

In the endless trail of solitude and longing, my hollowness has only deepened.

Morpheus! Even he betrays me nowadays. He never gives me dreams anymore. It‚Äôs like he is saying to me ‚ÄúYour time is up Foziwi, your account is closed now. I don‚Äôt have any more dream funds for you.‚Äù

I appreciate his japes. As for such emptiness, dreams can only be illusion and not some self-reflection. On the other hand this harmlessness suits me. My hollowness. My emptiness.

I darkness I kept staring at my ceiling and I don‚Äôt know when in between the agony headache and suffocation of my lungs I slipped into the realm of Morpheus.

I woke up at the brink of dawn, staring at the sidewall with the only thought to kill myself. My head was still pounding. I guess, while my mind was in nether-realm, my body was in agony.

I peeked outside to witness whether the sun is dead. Unfortunately, it was not. So I did the next best thing, which was to close the curtains. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt want the sunlight to enter. However, I don‚Äôt want to witness my personal void escape.

This fight with life has been very futile for me. This fight with poverty, unemployment, relations of birth, relations of choice, relations imposed, to have a smile or to simply exist in this life appears futile to me. Sometimes I exist only as a witness. I witness the next day, the next person.

The fa√ßade has stolen everything that it offered. Yet I never disappoint it. I‚Äôm always lured into it. Only to be shattered again.

I don‚Äôt know when I became a poor excuse of man. But, I have been functionally living like this for quite some time now and I have figured how to exist. But unfortunately, I will always be part of those others."
2636,depression,Hollow,"I've made a lot of positive improvements to my life. Engaging in my hobbies more, working out, hanging out with friends and getting my life together. I feel better than i ever have before. Though, to get here i've ended up hurting a lot of people i care about and messing up relationships with wonderful people who don't deserve what i did to them  


Despite all of this, I feel so empty inside. As if, all the happiness i feel is just on the outer surface and inside there's nothing there, like i'm a doll.  


I've worked so hard to get to this point. I've sacrificed so much, ive hurt so many people, ive hurt myself. Yet at my destination, there wasn't anything there. I'm struck with waves and waves of guilt and suffering reflecting on whats happened the last year.   


But am i truly happy? I would say so in a more superficial sense i suppose. I'm enjoying life and looking forward to a lot more things. I smile and laugh a lot more now. But, its like the chains that hold me down are still there except i'm just not in complete darkness anymore. Yet, despite that my eyes are still closed so i can't see the light anyway.

2639,depression,My head is racing with countless thoughts yet my heart just feels so empty,Is this what depression + anxiety is like?
2640,depression,Making Friends and Taking Care of Yourself,"In all the suggestions to help raise you from a depressive state, you would see the mention of exercise. Going to the gym, going for a run, etc.  
I've tried many times to exercise at home. Some times I start for a few days and then stop, or I don't start at all. There's also the embarrassment that my mom lives with me(she couldn't and now I can't afford to live separately), and she would mock me if she saw. That's not me being paranoid, she really would. She's done it before. She tends to paint a dim view of my ability to do anything new that I would like to try.   
So I tend to try to do these things in hiding, and I can, but then I always excuse myself that I'm feeling too exhausted. I mean it, though. I'm always exhausted. Basic tasks sap most of my strength. 

So, I look for alternatives. I can't go running, because I live in a dangerous area. There's no sports clubs or anything around here.

And to be honest, I don't like the gym. I don't want to build muscle or change anything about what I am(for now). And when I was a bit younger, I was mocked by gym-goers for being skinny and not wanting to change that, so I don't necessarily like the environment. 

I honestly like my body frame. I'm somewhat tall and lean. When I was young, I prided myself on my athleticism and being light on my feet. I was the fastest runner almost everywhere and I was an excellent swimmer. I hate the idea of people telling me how I should look.

But the problem I have is that I'm no longer even remotely fit. And I hate it. A simple burst sprint will have me huffing and puffing and that's not good enough. I'm also starting to put on weight, which for me is a sign of how much I'm letting go of myself. It really just increases the already intense state of self-loathing I have for myself.

I love sports, I really do, but as I said, they're not prevalent in my area. I did find a place to go and hopefully join up with a football club, and when I had talked myself into being brave enough to go and try, mentioned to my mom where I was going, and she told me that I'll just embarrass myself. In turn, I didn't go. I flaked. Again. 

In my country, there are massive problems with how people socialise. For example, it is a heavily racially obsessed country, and so people tend(I need a stronger word) to associate with others of their own race. I've been a witness to this since my school days. In many ways, this has been a problem for as I am heavily mixed race. There isn't really any understanding of my heritage or what demographics I am descended from. My parents were mixed race, and coincidentally their parents were mixed race, and not much from a racial standpoint is understood beyond that point. While this doesn't bother me, it's always been a problem for others who constantly want me to fit their perception.  
And so, I am indeed scared of being the odd one out. The anomaly. I feel like that in my own home, and I've felt that way a multitude of times throughout my life, and I don't want to go through that again.  
Which leaves little in the way for friendships and spontaneous moments. Fear.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, after my intense rambling, I do have a question.

For those of you who partake in regular exercise regimes and have kept it going, if you ever felt like me, where you had apathy towards everything, and chronic exhaustion, how did you manage to combat it and get started?

I typed all of this just for that. Apologies. .\_."
2641,depression,I think I may have depression but I don't know how to tell anyone.,"Sorry for this long post, I just wanted to get this off my chest.

My negative thoughts kind of started when I was in college (2016) and started doing really badly in school. Eventually after 2 years, I got really bad grades for my final exam. So while most people I knew were going to top local universities, my only real option was a private university. Because of this, my mother and I got into a lot of arguments (2018-2019). During these arguments, she would often bring up how I wasn't hardworking (she is half right) and shit talk me just because she wanted to shame me over my bad results even if the argument had nothing to do with education at all. She often threatened to kick me out or not leave me any inheritance. For these 2 years I was serving conscription and had some time to re-evaluate what to do next. But frankly, her constant attacks on my results has dragged me down to a point where I was afraid to talk about it at all. In addition most people who go to college here do really well so it made it extra shameful to talk about my results among my peers. Because of this I distanced myself from most of my friends but none of them really bothered to reach out to me as well. 

Last year, I was really tempted to shoot myself a few times during my duties/live firings because I felt I had let everyone down and it didn't seem like any of my friends ever genuinely cared for me. And my whole family was always harping on my poor results as well (too many details to go into). But I never did because I lacked the balls. 

This Covid situation hasn't really helped either. While I am definitely not suicidal now, the lack of opportunity to get to know new people from online lessons while seeing my ex college friends expanding their social circles in their top universities makes me feel really unwanted and more depressed. I just want to be normal. I just want some friends to care for me.

P.s: I know my mother loves me and I am definitely flawed (and to be blamed in many aspects), but I feel really lost, direction-less and miserable. And honestly a huge part is because she kept dragging me down.

Thanks for reading."
2642,depression,Why isn't male depression taken seriously?,"GENERALLY speaking women were more fragile, emotional, and moody in the history of mankind and thus get the better end of attention and they do deserve it, but how come male depression is a joke?

I just think if you have depression and need help you should be able to get help and get taken seriously relentless of gender identity, race, or wealth. Cherry on top is when I reached out to professionals and they denied help because of covid (I reached out to 5 in my area), I just feel like the whole world just wants to get rid of me."

Everyone is fanatic,  they do not hesitate to say bad things about people against them. Going into traffic is like suicide. It is guaranteed that you will be involved in a meaningles fight.  Bullies never go to jail,  never get punished. 

  Our currency has no value, government get extreme taxes.  there is no social activities for poor people. There is no way for poor people to buy things except basic needs. Even foods are expensive. 

  I have never been a child. I have never played happily. I have never learned any sports.I have met the language english when i was 18 years old. I learned it by myself.  No one has  taught me anything. The education i got was no good. I just strived and strived.  Everything i learned belongs to me, no one has any contribition on it. I am not egoist, it is a sad fact. I wish my schools and my teachers were quailified enough to make me well educated. 

People born in europe, or usa are just lucky. You can get well education,  if you start working you can have a car within a year with your minimum wage.  Now i am 20 years old. Altough my conditions were bad, not proper for studying, i won  the best university in my country. I will be computer engineer  4 years later.  I am not making any money as a student . I will live 4 years too as a poor man. After that i can get salary let's say 4000 turkish liras. 2000 tl is rent, 1000 tl is basic needs ,1000 tl is savings. 

To buy a  car i sould work 100 months. Cheapest car is around 100 thousand turkish lira. After that to buy a house i should work 400 months. These  are  just two basic needs. Travelling is luxury.  1 dolar is 8 turkish liras. It is not possible for me to travel europe, USA or any other country. I have never been abroad.   

How can i not be mad about my country, my faith.  My life is worthless, i was born to suffer. Enjoying this life is not possible for me. My question is how can i go back to year 2000 and be born in well developed country?  I just want live my childhood and youth. I want to be well educated. I want to feel secure when i go out . I want to say my opinions without fear of getting arrested.  I want to do sports in  well facilities. I just want to enjoy this life"
2646,depression,My externalisation of my feelings,"I feel blue so deep down
The internal agony of not knowing how you feel
I do not feel real i do not feel the things i felt when i was a kid
what is the point of this life if it is going to end and i will lose everyone i ever felt close with
All the bad things, the anger outbursts are esting me from inside
how could i forgive myself for all the suffering, the ruined moods and days of people close to me
Why i do not want to have fun but only be alone and dwell on my feelings 
Day from day trying to find an anwser which probably does not exist
Short burst of joy when I find an explanation are diminished by my lack of motivation to help myself get better.
I don‚Äôt believe anymore that one day it will get better, i do not believe that there is an answer to my problems and I just can‚Äôt stand the idea that I would have to learn and ‚Äúcope‚Äù with this feeling.
How can You cope when the motivation, the joy, the charisma, the energy, even the basic feeling of reality is being taken away from You.
I feel worthless, like a big lump of fat, junk food, nicotine and all the shit that comes into my body. 
I can‚Äôt be persistent in things like working out, yoga and meditation as one day i just wake up and say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù.
The idea of taking my own life seems more appropriate every day.
Why not? Why not because I am afraid to live, I am afraid to have fun, every day I am accompanied by feelings of depersonalization and derealization, on each step I question reality, most of the time I just zone out.
Even suicide starts seeming not an answer because I cannot believe the notion that everything will be over, peaceful and loving on the other side. Everyday I feel like this, how could I cope with sudden feelings of relief and hapiness. It even becomes as a place of comfort - feeling depressed, angry, worthless.
The idea of everything being ok and that my brain would just forget all this stuff I went through. 
Would I feel happy if I got relief? Probably not as the traumatic experience would remind of itself in my memory, keeping me from living my life.
Everyday I spend hours searching for an answer in neurobiology, genetics, spirituality, psychology with no help as I still feel as an observer watching myself trying to crawl out of an ever growing blackhole."

2648,depression,Desperate for drive but emotional fatigue is always winning,"I wish I could elaborate the exact words to my mental state, I feel and know deep down I am losing the battle against my mind again. Because of my physical and mental health, I'm currently not working, and the guilt I feel from relying solely on my partner worries me that I'm dragging him further down. He has more than assured me that is far from the case and wants to help me through my grief and trauma. 
I'm still so very empty without autonomy or routine.
Always exhausted or always restless.
I keep hoping for more to life than being boxed inside and losing the will or drive. Waiting for him to get off work. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting.
I used to be so patient, but I feel so chronically alone with my headspace and thoughts. It's dehabilitating."

I like to sleep, it‚Äôs like a relief, or break from anything going on in my head.
There are people who don‚Äôt understand though, they‚Äôre just like ‚Äúhow can you be so tired when you haven‚Äôt done anything‚Äù
And it makes me feel horrible, I know it‚Äôs probably not intended to make me feel that way, but I know there are people out there who work so hard and can barely rest, where I‚Äôm always just tired.

i hate how lazy i am. i hate how i can barely focus and process information. i hate the obsessing over every negative in my life. i hate sleeping because i have no motivation to do anything else. i hate the random crying episodes. i hate the numbness. i hate it all.

i internalize everything i feel when i‚Äôm depressed, as if i‚Äôm doing this purposely, i just feel so much shame. i feel so weak and pathetic. i know it‚Äôs not my fault, but seeing myself in the mirror after a day of laying in bed and just sleeping and not having changed clothes in days or brushed my hair, i just feel so much hatred for myself for getting to this point, i‚Äôm so mad at myself for struggling."

But for months now, I feel sad in general all the time. Especially if I'm not doing anything, my mind wanders and in the end i always end up thinking how i have had a shit school life. I had good friends there but i still felt left out on the fringes.i have been bullied a few times, not alot. I havent had a girlfriend cuz i ended up being friendzoned each time. And then everyone says I'm such a nice guy n they wud like to b frnds. I know its not that big a deal. I know its not the only thing my life should b about. But thats the worst part. I know all that n how theres so much to it then just girlfriends n sex, but i still cant help being bummed out about it. Since a couple of months, i have ended up crying about it multiple times n i dont know what to do about it. I know it shouldnt be this big a deal. But the lack of a social life, lack of validation n acceptance has got to my head so much now and I cant help it. Its just too much."

All I could say was ""Well Ill be dead so I wont really feel anything "" and laughed a little bit. More like a stress laugh.



And he comented on how I think Im funny and to stop laughing. 


Idk if that is how he show affection and trying to stop me from killing my self or the contrary. But in multiple occasions he has heard of people killing themselves has called them coward peace of shits worth nothing who dont have an ouce of intelligence and that killing your self is for the weak and does good on the world weeding out weaklings.

None of my therapists ever tried to understand what I was going through. I feel so lonely n broken."
2659,depression,Why therapy is a useless joke to me.,"Less than useless, even. It is actually damaging. It forces me to think about and dwell on all my problems in depth at least once a week, with no real solutions being offered. It is also nothing more than a cold business transaction. I pay the therapist for an hour of their time to serve as nothing more than a glorified sounding board. I don‚Äôt desire a personal relationship with my therapist,  just as they don‚Äôt desire one with me or any of their dozens of other patients going through dire circumstances. That‚Äôs why, to me, just one good friend is worth a million therapists. Someone willing to actively listen to you and offer feedback (when asked) is far more priceless and helpful than any of the so-called ‚Äòexperts‚Äô who charge $150 or more for fifty whole minutes of their time. Unfortunately, they are as rare as they are valuable these days. Haven‚Äôt had a good friend for over a decade."

One moment I have a more or less fine mood, then suddenly I get sick with the need to throw up and I feel like I want to die. My whole family is making the whole situation worse. They assure that they make me feel like an ungrateful pos every day. It's like their mission to ruin my mood and every single day in my life. They don't care about my feelings and happiness just want to force their visions, wills etc on me. They are egoistic and narcissistic. I'm exhausted both physically and mentally and I can't cope any longer with any of these. I can't afford to somehow move away and try to get my life together. I feel like I'll always stay in this toxic environment no matter what I do. I legit feel like suicide is the only option. I  just can't.

I don't have motivation anymore to do anything. Things that used to give me excitement and entertainment before don't excite me as much anymore. I used to binge shows and watch movies and read books a lot in school and like a year after high school. I don't have the motivation to those things anymore. When I do, it's just to take my mind temporarily off worrying about my life. I'm constantly distracted by my feelings of guilt. I've disappointed my mother so much these past years and I can do nothing about it. I feel so helpless.

Tbh I don't even know if I have depression. I'm not diagnosed or anything. There's this voice in my head that keeps telling me there's nothing wrong with me mentally and that I'm just trying to blame something else for being a failure.

2664,depression,Question on Effexor WD,"28, Male, 146lbs, 
Other medications include Kolonopin (1.5mg), Remeron (30mg), and Provigil 100mg. 



I recently switched from 225mg Effexor to Prozac, prior to that was lexapro. 

Effexor seemed to have an effect but caused me migraines that exceeded anything I had ever experienced before. 

My psych told me to taper down 75mg a week, but unfortunately I‚Äôm uninsured and would rather not pay another $30. 

I‚Äôm no stranger to WD (Benzos and alcohol) and I can‚Äôt imagine it being that bad, but what can I expect? I‚Äôm day 2 completely off, yesterday I was struggling to sleep and felt extremely uncomfortable. Today I‚Äôve been achey, slight flu like symptoms, and no chance of sleep.

2668,depression,I tried to get help and I guess the universe doesn‚Äôt want that?,"So the other day I got so upset and cried for the first time since November and decided I would fully be willing to speak to someone about my depression and actually do something for once. In recent months I‚Äôve started eaten a lot less, even going about 48hrs without food. My mum became concerned and told me I‚Äôd need to speak to a doctor because I kept telling her I was fine. However that never happened so I guess she was just bluffing. Because I can‚Äôt communicate any of this to my mum as I find it so awkward, I called her boyfriend and asked him to speak to my mum about an appointment for me. Then about 2 or 3 days later he called me back to say, if it was about physical health then I need to consider if it‚Äôs so serious that it requires a visit to the doctor in the country‚Äôs current climate, what with Covid and all, and if it‚Äôs a psychological thing I should avoid the doctor as it could be a hindrance to getting certain jobs in future, should a job require a health check. So I have baso concluded that this is a sign from the universe that after about 4 years of depression, I can carry on a bit longer without doing anything about it, seeing as the one time I tried, I basically got discouraged. :/

Tl, Dr: Was going to get an appointment about my depression for the first time. Baso got told if I want a job in future, it isn‚Äôt worth visiting a doctor and getting a diagnosis on my medical records. So now I‚Äôm back to pretending to be good."

I have 0 friends. My family doesn't understand and I'm not close with them. I've never been close to being in a relationship. Honestly I see myself being forever alone. I have nothing to live for. Nothing to look forward to. 

Something is just off about me. And its clear if God exists he doesnt care. So that means if there is an afterlife it wont be good either. I mean hopefully it's pure void but wasnt I in the void before I was born. Somehow I showed up here so why wont it happen again?

Life makes no fucking sense and everyday I get do see people who are in love , good job , good friends , good social skills, many non mentally ill people , people who got it better off. Sure I dont have it the worst and most people think I over exaggerate. But having wanted to brutally kill myself many times and being close I dont think is over exaggerating.

We were drinking as this conversation happened, and marijuana was involved too. I'm not sure what I was talking about, but there was a moment where I said ""I'm not sure whether or not I should-"" and stopped myself, but they finished my sentence for me: ""put a bullet in your head?""
It processed a moment and I broke down. I left as quickly as I could without being rude, and went to sleep when I got home.

Since then, I've been sliding downward, as I have done time and time before. I thought I was doing well. I thought I was fighting my depression and finally making my life better for myself. I guess I was wrong. Within a week, I've contemplated leaving my job that I enjoy, and I've been avoiding talking to people as much as I can. My work ethic has dropped from a hard worker to a lazy klutz. I've returned from being energized to exhausted all the time.

I can't date. I know the second my girlfriend or boyfriend meets the friends I hang out with, whether they admit it or not, they will regret their choice and if they say they don't they're lying. As much as it sucks we're all materialistic to some degree. They will always want the taller and stronger guy."

I went for several different combinations of medications in the last five years and was still unstable sometimes. Turns out that coronavirus happened and I never felt so stable in my life.

I've always had problems with social anxiety, and I think that the fact that I'm having a minimal interaction with people in the last five months is helping me keep sane.

I was always so stressed going to the university because I had to see people and talk with them... Some people are freaking out because they have social interactions limited, and I have not a single desire to go to parties, family or friend reunions, even less to bigger events. I've always considered myself antisocial, but I don't know until when this can keep.

My only problem right now is that I have my master's dissertation to finish and anhedonia is preventing me to do it. It's been really hard to find something that can keep me interested and excited for long. When I have to do something is a gigantic effort, but at least I'm not thinking that ending my life is a solution anymore, but I miss the kind of manic behaviour that I have when I'm obsessed with something... This way everything has no flavour and I don't know what is worse.

I press a button in my brain and it falls into the conversation like a tetris piece. There‚Äôs no before or after. Just the next tetris piece and the next until there is no need for one.

I have to explain everything to myself all the time in my head."
2701,depression,I'm so depressed I want to scream,"We're all going through tough times and to be honest, there's no major problems in my life. I hate how this disorder, disease, whatever you want to call it, comes and attacks you out of nowhere. I have been blessed in so many ways. I've been fine since January. I don't understand what's wrong. 

This episode has been going on for days and it feels like real sadness. Not the sadness I'm used to with depression, but almost like grief. I've been feeling like something is going to happen to me and its embarrassing to talk about. I sound paranoid. I have this whole fun and positive outlook on reddit and in real life but I'm so sad, lately. Its based off of nothing. I know I'm the only me and its special to be alive but sometimes I just want out."
2702,depression,bullied,"Hi guys. I worked at my job for almost a year. Monday I finally got sick of being treated like shit by the ones who'd been there longer than I. I'm extremely depressed. My eyes are bruised from crying constantly. I have tons of schoolwork to do and can't focus. I had an interview yesterday.
It feels like I'm not doing enough, idle time sucks. I know it's only been 2 days but it feels horrible.
Management and HR failed me, to protect themselves and the other few coworkers it seems. I guess I wasn't important, no matter how hard I worked. 
Has anyone else had this happen to them or a friend? I need advice in general.
My spouse is very supportive and is the one who said I need to just quit, because I've tried to get along with the 'ol biddies' long enough.
This sucks. Sorry for the long winded vent."
2703,depression,I don‚Äôt want to live like this anymore.,"If you‚Äôre reading this, I think I‚Äôve gotten to a point with myself where I can no longer function without feeling an overwhelming sense of emptiness. it has become a routine for me every single day to reach an extreme low in my mood, to the point where I must sleep or stay alone. It makes me unable to draw because I cannot see straight, and I can‚Äôt read because I get too deep into my own intrusive thoughts. It‚Äôs funny to be feeling this way right before I move to college and start the rest of my life, really. It‚Äôs even more funny that I felt this way much before and to this day, six days after my BIRTHDAY. Will I even be able to get to see what the future holds? Probably not. That is okay though because there is nothing for me anyways. I want to go into Biochemistry to help discover treatments for people, but I‚Äôm sure I won‚Äôt be able to find something the government doesn‚Äôt already have hidden away from the public until they can profit from it. No one really wants me around for long, in terms or friendship, and men only want be when I can feed into my sexual desires. I am so lonely and after dating someone for almost three years, them leaving you for a friend in a week, and being unable to find someone who loves me for over a year and a half now, I‚Äôve lost hope with romance, even though it is my main pursuit. All I want is to be hugged again and told that I am special and worthy of someone‚Äôs time and to be held and understood for once. I feel like I can feel my chest hurting when I try to breathe. It‚Äôs hard to type with tears in your eyes. I wish I could be good enough for just one person. Or even myself, really. I don‚Äôt think I can ever truly be happy or make someone else happy. I can‚Äôt remember things much, often forgetting if I even ate. I just make mistakes and make people not like me or just be a burden. I don‚Äôt even know if the free counseling at my college will help me, and it‚Äôs getting harder and harder to try and wait for it. Why prolong this feeling of misery I‚Äôve had for months when I could just finally be done with it? I wish no one knew I existed. I haven‚Äôt cried this much in a long time. All I want to do is stay asleep so I can stop overthinking the little things that trigger me into my daily downward spirals. I wish I had the guts to end it."
2704,depression,Trying to therapize yourself,"I‚Äôm always trying to tell myself why things are happening. I create these theories about my depressions and my emotions. The reasons for it. And by preaching to myself...it makes me so frustrated. I wish I could just stop analyzing everything all the time and just be. Is the analyzing causing it? Is the analyzing the one thing leading to a solution I should stick to?

I find that reaching these conclusions don‚Äôt do much...it‚Äôs an endless investigation...you can‚Äôt think yourself out of depression.

And then I started getting into spirituality. And I haven‚Äôt been spiritual since I was a child. Ekhart Tolle books, meditation, I just ended up feeling like I was forcing it all on myself. I‚Äôd get frustrated and confused. I don‚Äôt know...I just don‚Äôt trust my perceptions anymore...the way I do things...the things I‚Äôm writing right now...it just all seems like it‚Äôs floating around forever...and then I doubt if I‚Äôm even depressed. But this isn‚Äôt a pain contest and everyone‚Äôs depression is different.

I recently watched this video that said that resilience comes from accepting your depression and not keeping it a secret tucked inside of you. But I don‚Äôt think that means screaming out to everyone. So how do you make depression feel less like a secret impediment that you wish you could wish away? How do I stop automatically tuck away my emotions and snap into functioning. I don‚Äôt know... the thing is I‚Äôm not in a deep intense depression, but more that I don‚Äôt know how to make a decision or choices that will make me feel less like I‚Äôm trapped in a room that never changes. Like I can do all these things I‚Äôm meant to do...because it‚Äôs something. And something is better than nothing.

I‚Äôm rambling. But how do you learn to live with your depression rather than trying to solve it, because whenever I try to solve it, it just gets worse?"
2705,depression,I tried to kill myself yesterday.,"But I didn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know why. But I didn‚Äôt. I remember feeling frustrated that I couldn‚Äôt cut my wrist any deeper. 

Then I went to my father, and confessed everything. My feelings, my suicidal thoughts, what I just tried to do. And it went well. He responded calmly and told me that he was so proud of me for being strong. For not doing it, and for telling him. We had a long talk with him and the rest of my family. 

And he said that I‚Äôm not allowed to go to rooms alone, and my little sister should follow me everywhere. (My little sister doesn‚Äôt know).

But now I feel stuck. What should I do? I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd see this day. The feelings of numbness, and wanting to not exist is still there. I feel much much better that I told my family. But I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm living for them, for my little sister, and I can‚Äôt give up. But I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Please someone just tell me what."

2707,depression,How my life is now.,"Now I know none of you may care but I just got the sudden realization that I have no one I can talk to anything about. Like every one of my friends has that person that they can say anything to and they‚Äôll keep it a secret or they will try and help them through it. But I just feel like this is how my life will be till I die. No real friends, having to work 6 days a week, a college freshmen and just turning 18 having to live on my own. I‚Äôm honestly scared to start this new chapter in my life without someone there with me.

2713,depression,I don't know what to think at this point.,"I don't know if I have depression, I've always been hesitant to call myself ""depressed"" because of the stereotype regarding it now. It's got a real bad stigma to it I don't want to apply myself to, and I like to distance myself from that word. I guess to give context, I have absolutely no self confidence and I constantly see flaws within myself to the extent where I actively turn away potential relationships because I feel they deserve better than whatever the hell I could give them lol. It's a little soul crushing constantly being reminded of my position as the fat friend and people showing visible disgust when somebody jokingly says I'd make a cute couple with someone. Maybe I'm just tired, especially since It's like 1:36 AM. If you bothered to read through some of this, hi."
2714,depression,Bouncing Around the Room,"I‚Äôve posted this before - but I‚Äôm in that funky area in my mind again.   Funny how taking a break from work and resting can actually become a depressing experience.    Yeah, so the back story is something like this:

1. briefly homeless at age 15 - dad just didn‚Äôt pay the rent one day and was &lt;poof&gt; gone I never saw or heard from him again.
2. mother had a nervous breakdown at that time
3. due to a general instability in my micro family I left home at 18 and never returned
4. While still in my 20s I realize that I need to go to college or I‚Äôll always be trapped so I made a plan
5. I went homeless again, on purpose, and started school - got my electrical engineering degree in 1995.
6. my engineering job paid for my master‚Äôs in electrical engineering
7. I bought a house in one of the most expensive areas in the country

I‚Äôve got a few more cool achievements as well as a few more strikes against me during my early life - but, I‚Äôd best remain anonymous.  

I‚Äôve never been more proud of this.   I‚Äôve never been so alone.   I have no family at all.  The holidays really suck.  Aside from a few acquaintances from work - no friends.   If I were to die tomorrow only the bill collectors would miss my checks.    I‚Äôve lost purpose in life.  But, you‚Äôd never know it if you were to meet me.    

Every now and again I offer someone $100 to talk to me on the phone - yeah, that‚Äôs kind of pathetic - but likely safer than taking drugs.   Not that I‚Äôd ever want to take drugs.   Just saying there are more precarious ways to live and waste money.     

Thing is - my ability to form relationships just isn‚Äôt there.  I blame my early life - mostly concerned with raising myself, surviving and gaining the edge that I had always felt was mine.   I got it.   I got nothing."
2715,depression,Tonight is normal,"My normal has twisted so much, a normal night for me constitutes of being lonely and melancholic and wishing I had someone with me, while dreading my own existence and awake hours.
I feel like I'm a hopeless person and no one will ever love me, never hug me, embrace me, cuddle with me, want to spend time with me. I feel like I'm dying as alone and as sad and lonely as I am now, there is no hope, no closure, no light at the end of the tunnel, and no light or good ending for me, as this is real life, and things are just happening, there is no good waiting for me, there is only perpetual and continuous suffering"
2716,depression,I feel like I don't have any options,"On one hand, I'm terrified about failing the entrance exam to the grad program I want to apply to. I was banking on it in order to be able to move out from my parents house especially when I was always told that I wouldn't be able to score high enough. It's not a matter of re-applying. I know myself, and I'd rather just be dead than fail. Similarly, I've just been thinking about running away to avoid taking it. I know it's not sustainable, but a huge part of the above is that I'm tired of living my life. I hate it here in my hometown, I don't have any friends, this was my only chance to move out. It doesn't help that I'm depressed to the point where I more or less am ok with laying down on the floor and crying. I don't know what to do and I'm really scared about messing up."

But I also dont want to feel this way either because it's so intense. My emotions feel so dangerous and unsafe to me because in the past when I let myself feel these things I'd end up in the hospital because my brain just couldnt take it anymore. I know repressing isnt the right way to go and I cant tell you how badly I want to have good relationships with people without feeling that heavy elephant in the room that is my recent diagnosis. I know I need to tell people but I dont even know where to begin. I chatted with a childhood friend today and it was weird because we were talking about places to camp. It was hard and weird because the thoughts that went through my head were things like ""that's the place that person takes to murder people."" Or ""that's where the downward spiral that led to my ptsd started."" Shit like that. And what can I say? It's just weird to say shit like that to your childhood friend. But it's still what I've heard, what I know, what I've been through. But what can I tell people? How do I deal with these emotions and the darkness that surrounded me these past two years? How do I get back to the happy upbeat friendly person I used to be before ptsd? How do I pull myself out of this low? It's been a long time. I want you guys to know that I exist, that the feelings I have exist, even if I'm trying really hard to get rid of them, and that what I went through fucked me up. 
Also, I dont even know how many times I've left and rejoined this group. Am I the only one? ""I'm good! I dont need to follow this page!"" ""Ah, nevermind, turns out I'm not all better just after going on SSRI's."""
2720,depression,I ruined my life,"This is as unique as it gets for many of you but here it goes.

So, as a kid I wasn't great at anything but had potential. My dad was basketball pro (he actually played division 1 bball) and well I had some talent. Anyways life was great till age 16 no mental health problems even close to me and I did everything normal till I finally got laid and it was a long time coming but I was confident anyways yenno girl was hot and we did it then her period blood got on my hands. I was young and naive and well right away I told my friend and the idiot he is like me he got scared saying I had hiv and what not. So, for 3 months I dealt with anxiety of having hiv and all. i researched endlessly every night I literally prayed and researched and all signs were always pointing in me having the virus. I was kinda convinced I had it. As a result I Didn't eat at all and eventually lost so much weight. 

My hell ended luckily when I found out there is a clinic just to do testing and all. After I went and nervous few days of getting test back they came back negative. Life great right? Wrong apparently being stressed for 5 month straight was too much and I would literally get anxiety in every situation after developing a stomach issues cause of all this cause anxeria or smt (pree much something related to the stomach and I can't eat anything with gluten(pree much everything I LIKE or I have to shit)

Anyways I would somewhat fix myself due to a summer break after high school but I couldn't fix my body. I wouldn't ever get to play sports again cause my height which was peaking around the incident same like my dads did I couldn't play the sports I loved at 5'6. All the anxiety and lack of good nutrition ruined my dreams, respect and everything i had before.

When I turned 18 I couldn't get a girl to go on a date with me, got a scholarship to even the worst of schools which i would have had if it wasn't for this sh\*\*. Worst I feel everyone judging my body as weak and making fun of it is just wrong I got abs and what not I could have had a model type body if I had my height but due to one incident my whole image life is shattered.

Like it sucks I'm 23 now and all I got good memories are of when I was 14 realted to sports and girls. It sucks cause at 23 I feel i'm the ugliest in the room and shortest my life as truely gotten ruined due to one event and I don't know how to fix it. 

Like I try my best to stay positive and avoid girls and just study or play vediogames. but, I can't cause of relatives coming over and all they wana do is play sports or talk about chicks. And, those two things have taken away from me and it hurts that I end up crying every time after they go..:/"

My dad openly callled me a ""retard"" right into my face. Please tell me whats the sense of living.

I used to be able to talk to my husband about how I'm feeling but now he just takes everything personally. I feel like I'm getting care giver fatigue. I'm so tired and lost.

I‚Äôve always been extremely shy but during my first year in Ned school my shyness converted into severe anxiety and I spent first year in new school in sheer fear and anxiousness and awkwardness. I had no friends for better part of one year at my med school and was utterly devastated. But finally I gathered courage and went to one of our teachers(doctor) for help. He prescribed SSRIs and after couple of months I get better and made friends and life was normal till graduation. During that time I was using SSRIs on/off but by the end of my internship I became depressed and anxious at the same time. And since end of my internship and my dream of becoming a doctor getting real I am not able to work as doctor. I apply for jobs at hospitals, get the job but during my first day I become severely anxious at work and do not go the next day! That‚Äôs right I just quit, the desire to fight my fears is gone completely, I am completely and desperately hopeless. I don‚Äôt go out of my house, I fear people, I fear their judgements, I fear their anger, I fear the unknowns, I hate that I sweat so much I hate that I my heart starts pounding every time I am in a social interaction.
I also have anger issues and commitment issues as well and increased sexual drive that I hate.
So even if I want to go and join a job I cannot.
Thinking of starting the SSRIs again but they ducking make me a maniac and take away all my concentration abilities."

He mostly just games, works, or sleeps.  Iv been struggling really hard and had a recent attempt and ended up doing a partial hospitalization program.  He hadnt even noticed i was spiraling.  When i try to talk to him he dsnt know wat to do or say.  It doesnt help.  So when that happend he was upset that my bff(27m)  knew alot more than him. Around this time things got more complicated as well. My bff is also my roomate and i have a slight crush on him.  It makes me feel guilty and disgusting because i want to feel these feelings for my partner but i cant seem to anymore. And i also dont want feelings for my bff, its confusing.  My bff has been very supportive of me.  He notices when im having a hard time and always puts in an effort to cheer me up. My husband barely looks at me unless he is tryna get in my pants.  I dont know how to fix my marriage.  We literally bought a house together and have 5 cats together.   Iv been really struggling with depression these last 3 weeks and its getting harder everyday.  I just want to feel loved."

I just want help."
2730,depression,It's been two years since I've last posted here and nothing has gotten better,"I'm 14 now. It's been so hard these last few months.

I've gotten in many altercations with my parents. They make me feel really bad about myself sometimes. They say they want the best for me but then proceed to physically hit me multiple times and downplay my wins.

I understand that I can constantly improve, but I don't see why they only focus on my negatives.

My high school that I'm going to be attending has two schooling options: independent study or online class learning. I told my parents that I would specifically like doing independent study so that I can work at my own pace and have more freedom. However, without even telling me, they had already signed me up for online classes.

They told me that I wasn't responsible enough, I can't even take showers when I'm told (even though you're scientifically not even supposed to every day), I won't be able to do it because I'm gonna get stuck at one point and need help, etc.

They always point out my flaws and don't ever make me feel better about them. I get like one pimple a month and they're always saying it makes me ugly and stuff like that. And then they basically pin me down to pop it. (EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO.)

They essentially think I'm stupid or ""have no structure in my life."" It's also like they don't realize I'm at the top of my class and have essentially had perfect attendance since fifth grade... It's just like they don't even realize the positives about me.

My parents are always telling me to respect them and they can't even do the same to me. They think it's a double standard because ""they're the adults and I'm the kid."" I do love them, but sometimes I just don't know...

There are other things going on in my life too that make me feel really down. Like, one of my friends gets a lot of what he wants when he asks his parents. I know parents shouldn't just buy everything you want, but he even has his own credit card. And to my knowledge, it always seems like he gets $20 fairly often. I'm lucky if I get that amount of money in a year.

I'm very aware that I should not get everything I want, and maybe my friend is an extreme example. But whenever I ask my parents for something, they like to guilt trip me. I'll ask for something and then they'll bring up how I accidentally broke a mirror when I was like 7 or something. And how I can't even respect my stuff or them.

I feel as if I should just be happy with the essentials they provide me. They provide me with even more. This post might even make me seem spoiled (because it's somewhat true, I mean, some of these are the most First World problems). I think it's their mental (and sometimes) physical abuse towards me that makes me realize that they are not providing the safest and most logical way to ""teach me.""

It's honestly just so unfair that people like me are born in poorer families. I know my parents try their best, but in the end I never asked to be born. And sometimes I never wanted to be."
2731,depression,Rant ig,"I‚Äôm tired. 

I‚Äôm being crept on by thoughts of my abusive ex, how she emotionally manipulated and abused me, how she would sometimes physically hurt me, how she said she loved me and left me multiple times just to keep me there on her strings. 

What if she didn‚Äôt love me, what if no one does. They all just act like it. 

I‚Äôm never the first person people think of. Everyone hangs out and I‚Äôm just here depressed. My friends tell me all of the fun they had with plans I was supposed to be included on.

My parents may or may not have lied. Both of them would say the other did wrong and then the other would say they‚Äôre wrong and would tell me bad things they did to me. 

I don‚Äôt wanna trust anyone, the more I do the more I‚Äôll get hurt.

I don‚Äôt know what to say anymore on this. I feel like there‚Äôs so much, but I can‚Äôt accumulate the words. 

Whether it be a bullet or 19 shots of tequila, I‚Äôll forget the pain.

Hopefully someone will show me the love and affection I need to feel better. 

My mental health isn‚Äôt ever going to get better. 

I‚Äôve planned my future too many times to want to actually want to even have a future anymore. 

I‚Äôm tired"

My sleep schedule is all off right now which is a huge depression trigger for me. On top of that, I have MDD with mixed features. My lows are LOW, and I think I‚Äôm falling into that right now. 

I hit a wall yesterday. Someone I knew from high so is the kind of person who is never single and has been engaged about 4 times. She just got engaged to her newest guy and it made something snap. I just felt... empty. 

I was doing better today until I laid down to go to bed. The only person who ever said they loved me was one of the shittiest people I‚Äôve ever met, and that was pushing 10 years ago. I‚Äôll be 28 soon, and I feel like there‚Äôs something wrong with me.

2737,depression,I did it again and I‚Äôm so mad at myself,I was only a week clean. I was literally only a week clean. I relapsed again. I couldn‚Äôt fucking help it. Everything is so much and I‚Äôve never considered myself suicidal but sometimes I just wish I was gone
2738,depression,Talking to myself,"Life feels like a party I ended up at because a friend drove me there without asking. I don't know anyone. I want to, but the faces and body language say there's no room. Small talk is painful but I'm afraid to open up to anything deeper despite how badly I want it. I know it's pointless to ask for reciprocity. People either will or they won't. When someone forgets my name while I remember their favorite movie from our first conversation, I die a little inside.

I struggle to trust, but when I do, I trust the wrong people. Every burst of emotion that escapes I want to take back the moment it slips out. The more people know about me the less comfortable I feel. I want to disappear, go far away where no one knows me, but eventually the loneliness will catch up with me again. My problems feel insignificant. It's pathetic to turn over a single meaningless interaction in my head until I'm sick of existing but I can't help it. 

What is it like to live without ghosts dragging you down? At least people can see a broken arm. When your brain is broken it doesn't compute. Shape up. You're fine. I want to be okay by myself, but I can't stop hoping that this time will be different, and I'll have that moment that lets me tell someone else with confidence later on that it gets better.

I'm afraid of being someone who knows that it won't."
2739,depression,"I was ready to leave, now I can't","Everything was ok until she appeared, i don't want to continue with this ""life"" and i was ready to do it. But now we are a couple, at least now i have someone to disappoint, someone to make feel sad with my death. 

I love her and she could be my one and only reason to live, but there are a couple more reasons to be death, my past cannot be fixed and my personality, my life is destroyed. I don't want to pollute her with all of this but im not strong enough to leave her in both ways, I don't want to hurt her or make her feel sad. I love her and i should be happy but im not, its even more painful, but at least its a double edge weapon. I wish she could cheat on me and hurt my feelings so i get another reason to leave and hopefully the strength i need to do it."
2740,depression,Depression is feeling completely disconnected from everything and everyone.,"It‚Äôs not ‚Äúbeing sad.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt know how to form connections with others anymore and I don‚Äôt know how to enjoy things that used to make me happy. All I wanna do is fucking sleep. I just have no desire to do anything else. 

How do I fix myself"

2742,depression,I thought I got over depression but here i go again,"After 10 months I'm depressed again. I tried so hard to get over depression and i achieved but now it's happening again. I thought I've evolved, I've become a new woman, I've felt so strong than ever but now i feel very miserable, weak and lonely again. I let down myself. I thought i would be that weak woman ever again but  I'm here that point. When i close my eyes I see that scene I'm cutting my wrists. I'm tired too tired. It feels like i won't be able really happy in my life. Depression is like a old enemy to me never stops chasing me. It hurts my soul, my mind."
2743,depression,Why do I always fail?,"So, my whole life I've never quite fit in, I've been very misunderstood. I was always weird, but until my late teens, I was very kind.

I was very kind, but I got bullied and humiliated in front of people all the time. At school, at work. People just didn't like me. Maybe the combination of me being weird (which probably made me unlikable) and being nice (which made me an easy target.)

I even tried to fit in. I've always tried, but in Highschool I tried REALLY hard. Still, every part of me was picked apart. How I talked, how I walked, every single flaw in my looks from head to toe.


This even happened in public. I went to a New Year's gathering, and while everyone was saying ""Happy New Year's"" to each other, I tried and everyone ignored me. I even made tried with someone who had just congratulated someone else. I made eye contact, smiled and said ""Happy New Year's!"" And they looked at me for a second, but then sort of looked ahead of me to and ignored me. Not even their expression changed.

I noticed that all the people that bullied me and ignored me had friends. They would make a joke about me in front of the whole room, and everyone would laugh or just awkwardly stay quiet.

Well, by 18, I had become sick of this. So everytime someone tried to bully me at school, I bullied them back. I cursed them, called them fat, ugly, stupid pieces of shit, etc.

And guess what happened? I got in trouble with teachers, and people started calling me ""mean, rude, and a bitch.""

So, people can criticize me and pick me apart, to the point where I developed bipolar because I cried every night, and was just fucked with throughout the years.

When the ""bullies"" said shit to me, and treated me badly, people would laugh, and teachers would ignore it.

But when I started fighting back, I became the ""bad guy"" ""the bully"" and got scolded by the teachers.

Well now, I'm out of school. And I'm nice to everyone who's nice to me, and insult anyone who treats me like shit.

But again, when I defend myself by insulting them back, I'm ""rude, mean, sensitive, too angry"" etc. But the people who put me down are never in the wrong.

Because they're more ""likeable"" and probably because in all honesty they're more attractive. I look like shit.


So if I'm nice and let people walk all over me, hold in my feelings, and cry into my pillow at night I fail.

When I fight back, I fail.

Was I just born to be hated and shit on by everyone forever?"
2744,depression,Am I dead?,"When does a person die actually. Is it when our soul manages to escape from our bodies or when we loose the will to live. Ever since I did wrong by someone I love, I don't feel good. It's almost been more than a year and all I can think of is how badly I treated them. Since that time I've been trying to numb myself with weed and alcohol. I've dropped outta college and my future doesn't promise much other than failure. I often think of doing the obvious but I'm not strong enough to do so. Everyday it feels like a heavy object is weighing me down. I can't talk about this with anyone (not much of an extrovert). I have no ambition and all that I used to be is lost within myself. I wake up with an heavy heart and I passout drunk and stoned. Many a times I think to myself I should start living again. So as of now am I alive or am I dead."
2745,depression,How to become more honest to others?,"Whenever I want to talk to someone about depression or about cutting I freeze up. I just can't bring myself to tell anyone, I know my parents would be very sad and they where when i told them that i felt depressed but even when I spoke to a therapist I couldn't tell them that I was cutting. Dose anyone have advice that they have for telling people your problems?"

2748,depression,Anhedonia is Back,"I was suffering from major anhedonia from about August of last year to around June of this year. I was so glad to be free from that. Other than my lack of tase (which we think is something else), I was back to normal.
School is starting next week. I‚Äôm doing college applications. I have 3 online classes to finish within the week. And I just don‚Äôt care at all. Things I used to like doing I don‚Äôt get enjoyment out of anymore. TV shows or videos I usually loved to watch I just listen to for background noises.
I feel as if I‚Äôm in an endless cycle of me being really depressed, getting a quick moment of relief, then going down into the spiral again."

I'm tired of pretending to be happy. When I finally show my real self, no one was there for me. I'm tired of faking my depression. Tired. I'm at my last point, and I have no idea if I can survive 2020. Let me be my true self for once, and not pretending to be happy. Fuck all of this."

But I can't find it, and when I go on a walk, it feels like there's something there that makes me Anxious or when I'm around people and they ask how I am I don't want to say how I feel or say that I feel okay because it's a lie as I don't feel well I feel like I'm slowly being driven insane.  My emotions and issues and trauma and things I see, hear and feel, all sit in my mind eating it away driving me slowly to the brink of insanity. Then I proceed to freak out like I did last night, and it all goes to the back of my head again for about 4 months or fewer than I have another one. I know that when you say you can't it psychs you out of it but I can't think of a word that would describe better than can't, I just don't know what to do at this point and most of my friends tell me I should keep my issues to my self, etc. but I don't know where else to go so I hope someone can at least relate to me."
2752,depression,I‚Äôve ruined everything,"I‚Äôve realized that I‚Äôve messed things up beyond repair. Things can‚Äôt be fixed and I‚Äôm tired of living this way. I‚Äôll wait till it‚Äôs closer to my test, but I‚Äôd rather be dead than fail it."

my Depression is slowly eating me alive and I know it's only a matter of time before I eventually kill myself"
2754,depression,Going through it bad.,"I have clinical depression. My meds are good but I‚Äôm concerned about running out since losing my health insurance. Right now with the pandemic. Job loss. Unemployment being denied. Pandemic moratorium on evictions ending. Worrying about my kid going to school. Being on a ridiculously bad sleep schedule. Just everything. I‚Äôm feeling suicidal. The hotlines feel weird. It‚Äôs my nature to be jovial on the phone. I‚Äôve been told they really should let me go so they can talk to people who are feeling bad. As soon as we hang up I feel non-jovial again. So maybe my issue is being so lonely. When I lost my job I lost my social life, so to speak. Nobody has contacted me since I was let go at the end of June. I‚Äôd been there more than 5 years. That fucking hurts too. 

I haven‚Äôt made a plan. I know my kid would be alone in the world without me. 

Thanks for reading."
2755,depression,I feel like a baby,"I'm someone who craves constant compassion and codling. All I want to do is have someone take care of me and feed me food and hug me. I find this weird as I'm someone who highly enjoys independence.

Sometimes I just feel like a helpless baby being abandoned to fend for itself."

Which that 1 phrase meant you're not and you could only say that and i use that all the time cause I am not I am not fucking fine I am never fine I and there is NOTHING it is killing me inside I am not sure if I could go through another year of hell cause this is not me I am a monster to everyone I am the loneliest person in the entire world and I can't take it anymore the I don't want to be alive and I am scared of living I am just a huge burden to everyone even though there is someone beside me I do still feel lonely I wanna give up!"

2759,depression,My best and only friend is being distant and I'm at the lowest I have been in years.,"Let me give you a sense of our relationship. We met in high school. We went to different schools but always saw each other on the weekends. We had a mutual best friend who passed away a few years ago. I would always invite him to our band practice. Practice couldnt start without this guy. The fallout was so intense I went crazy. I had to live with him at his parents for a year. We would smoke and drink together and talk about music.

We've been through changes and always kept in touch. Its been about 12 years.

Recently he has been making plans with me only to tell me that he's going camping or to the beach with someone else at last minute. He even used to talk about how he didnt like those people. He hangs out with them at every chance and I am rarely invited or considered. If we make plans, he cancels them the day of sometimes to hang out with someone else.

Recently I bought him a very expensive birthday gift, and in return he gave me a gift as well, a very nice guitar he had lying around. It sounds fantastic.

I sent him something tonight and he just responded with a picture of a campfire. I think he is trying to tell me that he is moving on from our relationship, but he doesnt want me to be hurt.

Should I just stop texting him?

Another thing is. His girlfriend (who he lives with) is attracted to me and Im attracted to her. There is enough there to make him uncomfortable, especially when we've all been drinking. I think that puts a heavy strain on our friendship.

I'm posting this here because I am at such a depressive low that I can't do anything but lay in bed. He is the last person left who understands me, but I think I need to move on and find new friends."
2760,depression,The magic number 25,"I've met a lot of people over the years and they all seem to say that by age 25+ is when they need to have their life together. They have to be living on their own, be already working in their career, and some say that's when they already want to have a significant other or be married by then. Yet, even though i know this is not very realistic my mind still subconsciously believes i need to be ""perfect"" by then. I have met people  22/23  years old telling me they feel like failures because they're still in community college and single as they down a bottle of alcohol. I'm only 21 but people have already started called me old, and when i hear that i start to think what i've done with my life. Then the horrible things that have happened to me over the years start flowing in. I spend days and weeks so unmotivated that i can't even lift up my paint brush or instrument. The only thing that forces me out of bed is my job, because if i don't go then i'll be broke. I don't want this time limit but society and especially my family seems to be forcing it on me."

2764,depression,Who is your reason for staying??,"The one and only reason that I am still in this world is my best friend, I met him by chance and there was virtually no possibility we should have been friends, but against the odds we became close. He was the first person I ever told about being suicidal and the same night he called me and stayed on call long after I fell asleep. A few months ago he called an ambulance for me and saved my life. He made me pinky promise that I'd stay, so far I've kept that promise. It may get tough but I don't break pinky promises.

Who is the reason you're still living???"

2769,depression,Here to help,[removed]
2770,depression,what do I do?!! I‚Äôm losing my mind (this is long),"long story...
so I decided I wanted to end my three year relationship. It was like reliving the same episode of a show every day. I worked with him, went to school with him, and hung out with him every single day. I decided to end the relationship about two weeks after our three year anniversary after our high school graduation. 
Prior to the end of the relationship in June, in April, I started talking to a friend I met in school who was a year older than me. He lived far away across the country but we became very close friends. I helped him through the end of his long distance relationship of a year. We FaceTimed every single night in April. I started to catch feelings and it was scary to me, but I was making it obvious to him that I had feelings. So he became uncomfortable with talking once I told him I had feelings. I didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself, I lost 10lbs over the course of a week, and I was highly considering ending my relationship over even having thought of another person on a highly emotional and romantic level. 
But we stopped talking and I resumed my life with my boyfriend again. It wasn‚Äôt the same though and I wasn‚Äôt happy. 
Slowly but surely, over the course of May, my old friend came around and we started talking again as friends, but not on a close level. He swiped up on my Snapchat story and every time it would still give me butterflies, but I didn‚Äôt think twice about it. He told me he was coming back home permanently to where I live (and he grew up here too before he moved). I was so excited to see him, even if we just were friends. 
So I hadn‚Äôt updated him on anything over June really, but I was starting to become infatuated with another person again. I had anxiety issues and the fact that I was infatuated over ANOTHER person AGAIN drove me insane. Although, it was enough to convince me I wasn‚Äôt happy in my relationship. So I decided it was going to come to an end. 
I FaceTimed my old friend, and told him what was going on with my life and he told me what I was doing was going to be best for myself but I shouldn‚Äôt continue to be with the person I was infatuated with. This was because he knew the other guy and knew he was a toxic person. One night later, my friend flew home the midnight after my breakup. 
I saw him the next evening, where we hung out for an entire 24 hours straight. Actually, 48 almost. We could not be separated. I realized that I had no mourning over the end of my last relationship and this was the person I wanted to truly be with. So we started dating the fifth day he was home in town. 
Up until around the 20th of July I lived in pure bliss. Then, he started working and becoming more and more distant at the drop of a hat. I question every single day if he wants to be with me. He‚Äôs so wrapped up in the fact that his career failed because of his previous relationship. He‚Äôs lost in his head all the time, when I‚Äôm with him, it feels like we‚Äôre alone. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm gonna end up just like I did before where he cut me off in April but this time it‚Äôll be worse. Because this was all I ever wanted and now I‚Äôm highly emotionally involved. I get criticized for handling situations with such high emotion. He doesn‚Äôt truly open up to me about his feelings, and when I try to get him to, he pushes me away. All I want is to be loved back. All I want is to feel wanted again. And now whenever I see him, it turns to shit. I cry every day, I have anxiety attacks every week. But I want to keep trying so bad because if I end this relationship that means I‚Äôll need a ton of time to recover and I want to know if this is worth saving. I‚Äôm driving myself into the ground. god please someone help me with this"

2772,depression,I just woke up crying again,"I can't handle this anymore, the lack of sleep I am getting daily is killing me. The constant reminders of her and the stress that comes with it. I don't know who to talk to or what to do anymore, These same 4 fucking walls are driving me crazy. Why me? Why do I have to be so sad all the time? Do things get better? Easier? Why doesn't anyone answer me? Can you even hear me?"

Top of the class to bottom of the class, living the dream baby.
Porn and video games filled that void.
But hey, now I am depressed and everything will be alright when I find the one right?"
2775,depression,Everything is shitty,"People are shitty, relationships are shitty, life is shitty. I really am genuinely getting closer to killing myself each and every day because I don‚Äôt have any hope left. None of this will ever get better."
2776,depression,I have a feeling a lot of self proclaimed depressed people aren't really depressed.,"Disclaimer first. Whenever someone tells me they feel depressed I take it seriously no matter what. It's better to take it seriously rather than to leave a person to its own thoughts. BUT

I see posts/comments on social media like 'due to my depression I can't...' I find this really weird since you are limiting yourself options to eventually get over the depression. People seem to use depression as an excuse not to work on themselves.

I also think people make the fact that they have depression a personality trait. Maybe it has to do with that?

Now if I look at the symptoms of various depressions. I fit some of them as well. Although I don't claim to have depression. The main one is that life seems long in my eyes. But I keep telling myself I'm good to go. I find happiness in smaller things in life. Sometimes it gets harder and I stay in bed almost the entire day, but I refuse to admit I have depression.

Can someone please share their thoughts about this with me. I don't want to think a lot of people just use the term 'depression' inappropriately.

Ps: I lost my aunt to depression. It's a complicated mental illness I want to learn more about to be more emphatic."

I have never believed I‚Äôve had it in the past however for the last 5 years I‚Äôve dealt with severe depression and anxiety. Anxiety more so than anything. When I get happy I have a hard time with impulse control. I recently have been feeling way too happy and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs cause Im starting to get better and it‚Äôs a new feeling to me to actually like myself but I am also extremely uncomfortable. Like my bones ache in the way anxiety makes them ache, my muscles hurt, I am extremely hyper. I feel really good but sometimes in these moments if I am alone with my thoughts the happiness makes me severely uncomfortable. Like I‚Äôm too happy for my own good? Does this make sense to anyone? Or does anyone experience this?"
2780,depression,Envious of people who have their lives sorted,"I have put in a lot of effort into not comparing myself to others. 

But on some bad days, I would ccidentally come across the social media (FB/LinkedIn) profiles of some old acquaintances. It reminded me of how we had been classmates in the same school but we turned out so differently.

Here I am, quitting my job due to depression and struggling to stay in the game by taking online courses. Tired most of the time. 

Then there would be some other people who went on to score top distinctions in A-levels, got enrolled in top institutions and secured entry level positions at top firms. Not to mention that they're good looking, fit and have like multiple certifications in piano, violin, ballet etc etc. Makes you wonder how they did it. 

Those people plan the next steps of their career. My goal is to stay alive. I know I'm a disappointment and it's really sad to see how I've turned out."

Every day I wake up I wish I didn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm just so tired all of the time I‚Äôve stopped participating in things I enjoy. They just seem like they‚Äôre not worth it anymore, like it just doesn‚Äôt matter anymore to me. 

Things have only gotten worse since the end of the school year. I‚Äôve always been a straight A student, I‚Äôve never really had many friends but that hasn‚Äôt bothered me. I used to enjoy being alone. But now it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt enjoy it when I‚Äôm alone or around people. I want them to go away but I also want a hug and it hurts so much. I‚Äôm so lonely all of the time and have nobody to turn to.

I failed two classes and have to retake them. My parents yelled at me severely and since then have called me a disappointment and a failure multiple times. They have also stated I am lazy and do nothing but lay in bed, and the thing is they‚Äôre not wrong. 

I am a failure, and a dissapointent. But I can‚Äôt get it off my mind that my grades wouldn‚Äôt matter if I died next week, or if I was dead tomorrow. I‚Äôd be free if I was. I don‚Äôt even have anyone that would really miss me, no pets, just my family. And all they do is yell and put me down anyways so what would it matter. 

I know if I told my parents about this they would only yell at me more, saying I have mental issues and that non of my other siblings were like this. And if I told another adult they‚Äôd just tell my parents. So I have nobody to turn to but friends (I currrently only have one who ever wants to willing talk to me) . I‚Äôve tried talking to my friend and she listens but it never makes me feel better. It just makes me feel anxious and annoyed like I want to rip my hair out and yell at her. She keeps telling me to just hang in there things will get better but nothings changed at all and I‚Äôm starting to think it never will. 

All those comments people make about how it will get better just make me so angry and I don‚Äôt know why. I don‚Äôt even know why this started in the first place. It‚Äôs not like I had a traumatic childhood, it was fun and I was treated well. I just can‚Äôt take it anymore, this feeling of being so pathetic and empty and useless. 

I‚Äôm so tired, physically and mentally. I see no future for myself anymore. 

What should I do? I am desperate please, if I can‚Äôt find an answer soon I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt be able to convince myself not to do it. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm depressed because I‚Äôve never been diagnosed and I can‚Äôt tell anyone about this. 

Is this normal? I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm just faking it or it‚Äôs all in my head someone please give me some guidance."
2782,depression,I just want to be stronger,I know I can do it on my own. Yet I still don‚Äôt feel strong enough. Even if things get better for me. Like becoming a supervisor at my job. Every night before I go to sleep I end up clenching my fist and cry because I can do much better than this.
2783,depression,Sometimes therapy just reminds me of the bad thing,"And talking about the bag things don‚Äôt help after you‚Äôve already gone over them a thousand times. Sometimes I think therapy just teaches us to be complacent with the situation we‚Äôre in, when what really needs to happen is a change in the situation to find and let go of the things that make us sad.

 Not in every case, but in some, definitely, I think that therapy just reinforces how to tolerate a bad situation instead of fix it."
2784,depression,My daughter is the only reason I‚Äôm still here,"I would‚Äôve ended this awhile ago if it wasn‚Äôt for her. She‚Äôs only 4 and she‚Äôs what keeps me going. Not that I don‚Äôt think about it still, I do. Multiple times a day I think about just ending it all. I never will, I couldn‚Äôt do that to her. She probably wouldn‚Äôt really remember me but she needs a good role model in her life and she‚Äôs not getting that from her mom.

Just ended an 11yr relationship with her mom, we were married for 9 of those years. She cheated on me once, about three years ago, it destroyed my whole world. You go from knowing everything about this person to seeing them as a stranger overnight. It‚Äôs hard to explain. We reconciled and then a couple of months ago I caught her flirting with ANOTHER guy online, it ended with phone numbers being exchanged. I couldn‚Äôt believe it... not again. I was so against the ‚Äúonce a cheater always a cheater‚Äù line. I had just learned to trust her again. My whole adult life, every memory is now a painful one. The fact that we went through the work of getting over the affair makes it so much worse. It opened up that wound that was almost healed.

My birthday and Father‚Äôs Day were on the same weekend, a month after it all went down. My birthday was easily one of the worst days of my life. I‚Äôve been through it all, all the counseling, people saying it‚Äôs not my fault, etc.. I know it‚Äôs not. That still doesn‚Äôt make it any less painful. It still doesn‚Äôt stop you from wondering what you could have done to change things. Coming in second place to some stranger in the eyes of the one person you thought you could trust, the one person you thought you‚Äôd be with for the rest of your life... It‚Äôs the worst feeling in the world.  It eats at me every day. I used to be so happy, so easygoing. I was one of those people who thought depression was just a bullshit excuse for stress and for companies to sell their prescriptions."
2785,depression,I will die soon.,"My heart is weak. I've given it my all for so long to no avail.
WONDERING why? I can see everything written and hear all that is said. 
Time and space feel irrelevant. I'm a loser. Schmuck. Worthless human being, in a long line of ones that came before me.
I tried, I failed.
Nonviolence is my only source of Joy.
Do no harm, you do not matter.
Life is everlasting. Protect the innocent.
We all can relate to the ways life can cause pain.
Nothing is fair. Go on, live.
Make the next day bearable.
After bearable it forms into decent.
After decent it may become content.
I am 29 years of age and feel like a lifetime has passed me by.
I will not apologize for who I am. I will not bring sadness to others.
I wish for a peaceful world.
Yet that is not what I see."
2786,depression,lost my intelligence,"so ive been struggling with depression over many years now, it has taken a heavy toll on my cognitive functioning. i am not at all sharp or quick witted. i cant seem to think straight or make any decisions. now, over the past three years when i had gone long periods of time in complete isolation doing nothing but lying down in bed and rotting because i lack the motivation to do anything thanks to depression, my mind seems to function at an excruciatingly slow pace; i just cant seem to think; process information; think critically or form opinions; my comprehension just isnt there. also lets not forget how fucking hard it is to put together a coherent sentence; whenever i try to speak i sound like a complete retard. i seriously cant even talk in complete sentences and my brain is super slow. my memory also got affected; i had painful chronic headaches to accompany this cognitive decline. i also find it hard to grasp jokes and even sarcasm or atleast it takes me a while due to my inability to think having lost my comprehension. lets not forget how hard it is to hold a normal conversation. its killing me that i am struggling in school and i have this condition to fully account for my poor academic performance and inability to quickly learn or grasp new information.

ive had my iq evaluated by a psychiatrist and i came out above average with the only thing holding me back from accessing my true potential being severe ADHD; depression; and anxiety."
2787,depression,ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,"Soul is worn , spirit is torn. Just like eminem said.

I aint even here anymore . Cant give a fuck about anything. no one gets it. and if they do it changes nothing. life coulda been good, if i was attractive. instead, life fucked me. im alone in this shit and always will be. if i was attractive i'd have all the people in my life. funny how that works. funny how people lie and says looks don't mean much. they are delusional. Im a realist

Thats just the cherry on top though."
2788,depression,Why is depression so debilitating yet captivating?,"whenever my days get better, I'll miss my depressive episodes. whenever my depressive episodes come, I'll wish I felt better and more productive.

sometimes i wish i could be depressed enough to get intense suicidal thoughts and kill myself, because i'm sick and tired of this cycle."
2789,depression,What do I do?,[removed]
2790,depression,Forced Optimism &lt; Opportunistic Utilitarianism,"People who keep preaching that we ought to always look on the bright side of life trigger me.  

Some things are innately bad.

I‚Äôm sure one can concoct a positive spin on everything, but I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs healthy.  

Lately I‚Äôm exploring utility over optimism.  For example, if something bad happens - I‚Äôm much more inclined to ask myself how I can use it to my advantage than to thank the heavens for blessing me with more negative events."
2791,depression,I feel like I‚Äôm not good enough and I want to give up on everything,"I am in a load of shit and am having a hard time dealing with it

I‚Äôm going through a hard time rn and idk how to deal with it. I feel like I‚Äôm never good enough and hate myself tbh. It all started with a really good friend that I was friends with for a while and then he started bullying me. He bullied me into quitting wrestling and always told me that I will never get a girlfriend and that no one likes me. I was in a really bad depression and I told him and he told me in front of my friends that no one cares and that if I wanted to I should. I cut him off but I feel like he took a piece of me when he left. I don‚Äôt miss him but he is like a constant reminder that I will never be good enough. And my parents will always treat my younger brother as superior. I expressed to my mom that my brother always is given more credit to me when I do the same thing and that I am jealous of the attention that he gets because almost everyone in my family likes him better because he wrestles. She just told him so now I‚Äôm being made fun of for that by my family. I just feel like a useless pos that will never be good enough and that I will never get a girlfriend or ill never be better than my brother. Fuck, I love sports but I‚Äôm blown off every time I talk about it but my family is all over my brother. I just want to quit everything and stop trying."
2792,depression,Reddit's a Cesspool but Maybe the People on Other Subs Are Right,
2793,depression,Too sad to even do laundry,Just realized it has been months since I've done laundry... pretty much don't leave my house and wear pjs all day. I am disgusting. My house is a mess as well and I shower only when I have to leave the house for something to be presentable. I am so disgusted with myself but have no energy or motivation to do anything. I just have piles of dirty clothes all over my room. Most I can manage is waking up and convincing myself to get out of bed. I'm ashamed I let it get like this.
2794,depression,The quarantine is taking a toll on me and it's getting worse every day,"I hadn't seen anyone in 6 months until yesterday it was the best I've felt in a while.

This summer I have been taking a class to graduate early. I've been so anxious that I can't focus and I feel like such a failure. I'm 4 days behind now. It's not like I haven't tried to do my work. I legitimately cannot focus. I'm nervous about school starting back and not being able to focus on my work.

Politics are making me anxious along with everything else going on in the world. I'm not able to sleep much anymore and I feel like I'm going crazy. 

My parents are divorced and both are remarried and I'm dealing with family stress. My step-mom is Brazilian and so is my 4 year old step sister and the cultures really clash. My step-family and Dad keep going places when we're still switching houses with my mom who has been hospitalized with breathing problems. Not to mention, I already don't get along with my parents.

I've been talking to a guy I really like, but I have commitment issues and I'll probably find a way to mess it up. I probably won't even be able to seem him for a few weeks either.

Several of my friends haven't been talking to me since quarantine, and I feel like I don't have anyone. 

I'm starting to eat less and I've already lost 8 pounds. 

I just want to be held right now. I want everything to get better so bad.

TL;DR: Being isolated with family issues and the current world is making me depressed."
2795,depression,Y'all ever just spend the night taking to online counselors because you're lonely as fuck,"Heaving suicidal thoughts for the first time in 2+ years. Using online counselors as a replacement for friends because I literally have none right now. I realize that's unhealthy and will be something I bring up in my regular therapy session on Friday.
 
God I'm pathetic as shit lol"
2796,depression,I'm at that point again...,"15 minutes ago I was feeling perfectly fine. I was just scrolling trough Instagram, when I saw a post made my current girlfriend. 
A post clearly meant for the other person she loves. 

She says she still loves me, but she's just not attracted to me any more. All the while she's saying and posting to that other person, things she used to say and post to me. 

It crushes me, makes me hollow inside and makes me feel worthless. 

She was honest to me when she realized her feelings for that other person, what more can I ask for? 

I don't want to lose her... But it feels like I already have. 

I can't kick her out, we own a house together. 

And in a strange way... I feel like I deserve this pain. Like it's my fault. Like I've been a bad boyfriend, even though I've always tried to make her life better..."
2797,depression,Reddit's a Cesspool,"I was previously doxed, blackmailed, told to kill myself, etc. after I made an unpopular post and someone/some people decided they should dive into my post history and discovered I have PTSD. I've gotten no shortage of messages since. One in particular was interesting and considering that every goddamn thing in the world is closed down because of COVID and apparently I'm unloved even on the internet, it caught my attention

Flip a coin

The idea's stuck with me and I've found no support whatsoever on this fucking abomination of a social media platform so I'm almost leaning towards tossing a single dice as a compromise"
2798,depression,I cheatedüòî,I cheated on my girlfriend and i fucking regret it i want her to know how sorry i am about everything its going to hurt like a bich
2799,depression,I really have the audacity.,"I‚Äôm boring. I‚Äôm not that active in my hobbies and interests. All I do is jump from one social media to the next, watch a show, finish it, watch another one. And I have the audacity to want to have friends?

How I made friends in the first place is a mystery. I wonder why a few of them are still in my life. I feel guilty and undeserving of them. 

Guilty because I believe I somehow forced them to stay. Undeserving because they‚Äôre all great people who have so many chances at life and just overall better than me. And while they have their own problems, they make an effort to get better. And me? I‚Äôm a lost cause."
2800,depression,Feeling numb for the first time. Anyone relate?,"I have never felt this feeling in my life. An absolute feeling on nothingness. Last week, I was crying myself to sleep every night. Now, I feel nothing. I know that I‚Äôm at my lowest point, I just don‚Äôt FEEL like I‚Äôm at my lowest point. I‚Äôm going to cut off my abusive, controlling birth family and almost everything from my old life in less than two months from now. My partner cut me off. Everything is up in the air. Nothing will ever be the same. I‚Äôm not sure how to get over this feeling of nothingness, I‚Äôm just numb to it all right now. I guess I just seek reassurance that I‚Äôm not weird or crazy and that maybe some of you could relate."
2801,depression,My mentality,"People say that you need to love yourself to love others. That was a lie. I hate myself more than anything in the world, and yet I still love  my family. That‚Äôs why they can‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs why I have to hide it. Like, they know I‚Äôm sad, but if they knew all the messed up things I think, they would be crushed. It‚Äôs just rough not having anyone to go to. At this point, it‚Äôs expected. By now, life has hit me down enough that I don‚Äôt even bother hoping for good things or help anymore. If you don‚Äôt expect good things to happen, you won‚Äôt be disappointed when they don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs my mentality. I‚Äôve learned to live by it. I‚Äôll probably make another post some other time going more into my mentality, and explain it in more detail. Not like anyone would listen, but whatever. I don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt care about anything anymore. What‚Äôs the point."
2802,depression,Happy birthday to me!,
2803,depression,I should be grateful but I‚Äôm not,"TL; DR. I‚Äôm a miserable cunt who just needs to vent 


I should be grateful for simply just ‚Äúliving‚Äù but that‚Äôs far from the truth. I‚Äôm miserable, I‚Äôm so sad and I hate the way I feel. I‚Äôm paralyzed with negative emotion. It hurts to smile.  It hurts to think of my future because I feel absolutely hopeless with nothing to look forward to. 

My dog. I love her to death and she‚Äôs been sick since December with a variety of issues, costing me close to $7,000.  I already live paycheck to paycheck so the stress of this is sometimes unbearable. 

My job. I hate dealing with the public. I want to punch almost half of everyone that walks into the office for just breathing. I can‚Äôt.  

My weight.  I‚Äôm such a fat pig. I‚Äôve gained 60 pounds and I don‚Äôt even recognize myself anymore. Stupid anti depressants.  They caused this. My depression caused this.  I hate myself. 


Boyfriend. I love him but he‚Äôs selfish and I think lacks relationship maturity.  He should be with someone who doesn‚Äôt have kids who is like 25 years old. Also, someone without depression. He doesn‚Äôt get it. And when I try but to explain he tunes me out and is so absent minded, it just turns me off from wanting to share things.  I actually don‚Äôt think he truly loves me. He‚Äôs so detached and I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can deal with this.  And we live together so ....I think he‚Äôs just using me for cheap rent and blow jobs. 


Guilt. I feel so damn guilty for feeling the way I do because there‚Äôs far worse in the world. The guilt of being depressed when I should be grateful weighs heavy and I don‚Äôt know that I will ever be happy. And that‚Äôs what makes me sad.  The guilt for being so negative and not seeing the positive hurts my brain. I fight with myself constantly.  I feel like I‚Äôm losing. I hate this. I hate this disease and I hate how it makes me feel. 

I miss being happy."

Im tired of living in the ghetto. If feel the worst thig of all is i cant share anything with my girlfriend because all she does rank and compare our problems like its a competition, and all i want is someone to listen to me. My brother is a piece of shit. I insured a car for the asshole, trying to be nice, and he ruins it by getting about 10 tickets, i was arrested several times. The motherfucker wont even help. I cant drive since 2013. I recently found this out when i registered and insured a car, then a boot came. I never seen the tickets my brother got and lost my car because i cant aford it. Yet when things like this happen to me im overreacting when i get angry. Mind you this motherfucker just bought a van do you think he help me with my tickets nope. I feel like a crab in a bucket and ill never make it out, i never felt so lost."
2809,depression,"When we walk out in the sunlight we tell everyone we know it hurts our eyes, when the real reason we don't like it is that it makes us wonder if we're dying.","I spend most of my days gathering willpower.  


I wake up most mornings at 5 am. The room is still dark and that eases my transition. I spend about an hour in the darkness. Often the high point of my day. It can be soothing to not have to be anything, and it's easy to be nothing when there's nothing around. I spend the next hour preparing responses to the things I might be asked that day and setting mental alarms. I need time to build the will to do what I might have to do that day. Surprises are the worst. Everything takes three times as long for me. The third hour is spent building the will to move my body out of bed. Perfectly timed, as it starts to need food at around 8 or 9. I have to make note, because I just don't really ever feel hungry anymore. Breakfast is simple. Oatmeal with vitamin supplements. Everything tastes the same, so I just try to keep my body from feeling worse. Spicy food is okay, though. The rush of dopamine is nice.   


After breakfast, I have to psych myself up to brush my teeth. Sometimes I can't work up the quota. More times than I'll admit, honestly. Work takes a lot of willpower. 

I don't actually work. My body works, and I guess I technically work, but it's not me. I watch myself work through my eyes while work me titters away with his coworkers and smiles at customers. I've never felt an ounce of feeling behind my smile. Or any smile that I can recall, really. I like to count the smiles I get per day as a sort of metric to see how good I am at playing my role. The guy who's a part of things. Lunch is always light, as I have to prepare myself to socialize in a different setting and I don't get time to do that while I'm working. Out to the car and to a different parking lot to pick up something quick that I already picked up beforehand and back. Deception, thy name is me appearing to do anything spontaneous. I know nobody cares. I just don't like people knowing what I have to do just so I can appear like them.  


The drive home is nice. Sunset is always pretty. Looking at things I know to be pretty somehow makes me feel a little better for a while. Something to occupy my time. I don't really hang out with a lot of people. I did manage to trick a girl into liking me, or the me who she thinks I am. I like her, she's very nice and very smart. We make little jokes together that I'm sure don't mean much to her, but each one is a sip from an oasis to me. It's nice to feel things sometimes. The real me is starting to ooze from the cracks in the facade, though. I can see it hurting her every time. All things must end. If anyone knows that, I know. I just wish I knew how much sand I have left.  


Dinner is as simple as breakfast is. Just fill the categories. Some protein, some fruit, a few veggies. It all goes down the same. I guess I like the different textures, though. Carrots are firm and crunchy, potatoes are firm and squishy. Beef is stringy and a bit springy. I kind of like to squish it down with my teeth and feel it fray. Chicken feels like what bread would feel like if it were made of meat. I know the textures change if you prepare them differently, but that's honestly a pretty pricey item in the willpower aisle.

I don't shower. I keep my pelvis and pits clean with baby wipes, I wash my face once per week, and my hands every 10 - 15 minutes at work, plus after bathroom visits. I don't know why self-care takes up so much willpower. I used to not even do that, but I've resolved to improve. My hair doesn't get greasy, so that's one for the ""pros"" column of my existence I guess.

I don't know how to feel connected to anything. I float through the days, blown by the wind. I'm a bag of apathy filled with ash."
2810,depression,I feel like the worst is yet to come and it scares me and makes me more sad,"Im a male 19. Im in high school and i have been suffering from depression for about 4 years. Because of my depression i have fucked up my education, im 1 year behind my age group in school and it is inevitable that it will soon become 2 years. Im fucking tierd and so sad all the time. Im ashamed of myself, i don't like myself or my appearance. I feel like a lazy piece of shit. I have a lot of ""friends"" and by that i mean people who i care about but who doesn't care about me. They are nice to me if we happen to meet them at a party or something but will never initiate a conversation on social media. My family doesn't know im depressed because i feel ashamed to show or tell them because i feel like im a weak person for it. The only reason i haven't killed myself yet is my family and my best friend who seems to be the only person who actually cares about me. But my best friend doesn't have time for me all the time because he is very popular. I cant fall asleep because of my thoughts and often fall asleep in the morning because of being so tired and i cry myself to sleep almost every day. My dad who i look up to and love often says mean things to me which makes me very sad, i know he doesn't mean anything by it he is just a little bit strict but the worst parts about it when i later think about his comments and realise that they are true... 
i am stressed almost all the time about the future. My friends will soon graduate without me and it makes me feel ashamed of myself (almost all of my friends are one year younger than me). I don't know why but i can't control it but i fake being happy and okey infront of everyone. Now back to the headline. I feel like when my friends graduate they will all drift apart from me and i have no confidence so i don't think i will make any new friend IF i make it to university or college or whatever i will do in the future. I feel like i have no real reason left to live. Btw i have been to therapy consistently for almost 2 years it just doesn't seem to help. Im addicted to porn and feel discusted with myself i would like to stop and feel love instead. Im pretty active and going to parties partly because of the short distraction it gives me from the bad thoughts and partly because of my best friends who wants me there. So its not like i don't have opportunities to meet girls. I just wanted to write this post because i wanted to get it out somewhere because like i said i cant bring myself to talk to my best friend because i always fake being fine. Im so tired of being alive and would like to kill myself and most likely will at some point"
2811,depression,Never thought I'd do this again...,I've lost all will to live. Whenever I used to feel like this i just spend some time with my dog and I'll feel better and the cycle goes on and on. This time isn't like usual. This time I'm really making plans to end this. I don't want to do it but I don't see any other way out of this mess. I am so exhausted both physically and mentally. I don't seem to enjoy anything I used to. I get annoyed easily and it's not helping my family either. I know they'd miss me but they'd be so much better off without me. I can't do this anymore.
2812,depression,I AM SO TIRED OF THE WORLD,"People doing shitty things and making the rest of the world stereotype and generalize an entire group of people because of it.

People who think they can police or control women‚Äôs bodies. 

People who think they have a right to an opinion about other people‚Äôs lives that dont affect them directly or harm anyone. 

Politicians are all corrupt.

Government are corrupt. 

Doctors are corrupt. 

Rich people are all corrupt. 

Everyone is selfish. Everyone is bigoted. Everyone is terrible. The entire internet here is all trash too. None of us are more righteous or better than anyone else. We are all guilty of being terrible people.

2813,depression,Controversial: How much does this subreddit help?,"Hello all. I am a fairly new member within this subreddit, as I just stumbled upon it about a month or so ago. I have a thought and I was wondering if anybody else has an opinion on this as well. 

Does this subreddit help people break out of a funk or does it just provide more of the same dark feelings and thoughts?

I'm not saying that people are faking it or not being real. I've been in an extremely depressed state where I was thinking about killing myself and making plans in my head. I know how real it is. The darkness I've felt in those times is unlike anything I have ever felt before. It is awful, and the only people who know what it is like are those who have lived through it. In no way am I belittling the feelings and experience for those people. 

I was scrolling through the sub the other day and was reading all of the posts from different members. I read a post that really stung me. And I felt the depression and deep sadness deeper than before I had been on the sub. 

The basic question is this: Does this subreddit perpetuate feelings of depression and hopelessness? Or  is there a lot of great support that happens within the community? 

Would love to hear any thoughts. Again, honest questions from someone who has dealt with and deals with consistent depression."
2814,depression,No point in living,"For some reason, something doesn't want me to have peace here. I can feel it. Something is off about my life, and about this reality. Things don't seem right, or okay. And never really have. I don't think i'll be here much longer. I can't be saved . Or helped. I've tried it all. I'm too ugly to have a good life. I'm too depressed , dumb , and fucked up to have a good life. I may be schziophrenic supposedly, i know deep down in me its there.

I just talked with an online help person and they are so useless. Its all so useless. Life is a prison I think. Thats the only reason why I stay cus I think life is meant to be torture. And if i kill myself i'll get a worse life and get sent back worse off. Maybe if I don't kill myself God will have pity and give me a better life, but i doubt it. I'm not even religious, but i do feel like i'm being screwed with by a higher power.

Why couldnt I have a good life. Why do i need to suffer so god damn much all the fucking time. Why me. Couldn't I just have had something to be truly happy about? A person in my life? nope.

2816,depression,Unemployed Graduate lost in life.,"Long story short, graduated university last June. Still struggling to find full time. Rejections after rejections, started to question myself and my worth. Anxiety kicks in when seeing friends getting jobs, stopped applying to them, losing all opportunity to apply. Feeling hopeless and useless because my parents worked to hard to put me through school to only end up struggling to look for jobs, though they are not pressuring me to look for one because of the pandemic. I'm just lost in life, dk what to do..."
2817,depression,My friends suck.,"I try to be as nice and supportive as I can and in return I get passive aggression and no explanation for what's upset them. It's a waste of my time and energy. I can barely brush my teeth. I get kicked by strangers or family members everyday. Don't expect it from friends though. 
Why do I even care"
2818,depression,The Torch Burns My Hand,"Its been bout 10 months since I have had any contact with my exgf. She was very very cruel to me, but I still love her.

2819,depression,I hate living,"I‚Äôm just so tired of everything. My family thinks I‚Äôm crazy and doesn‚Äôt support me, they call me lazy yet I have a job even if I don‚Äôt work a typical 9-5 and im studying to be a nurse, my brother says I act like a child because I‚Äôm afraid of everything and I can‚Äôt drive far (I have really bad anxiety.) I‚Äôm just tired of being considered an adult I wish I was a child with no responsibilities I‚Äôm terrified of growing up. I don‚Äôt want to be alive anymore because it‚Äôs exhausting and everyone is so horrible to me I‚Äôm everyone‚Äôs punching bag. I have lots of trauma and I‚Äôve been abused by people including my dad. I would get help from a professional but every one I have tried has belittled me or made me feel like an attention seeker.

2821,depression,Jesus man i feel so bad,"All i've been doing the last 6 months is sit inside and game , go to sleep and repeat

I want to go outside but idfk what to do , i've got 2 friends and both of them are just as socially anxious as me so if i meet up with them i sit inside but just at their house.

Wtf kind of life is this? It's been like this for the last 8 years. Shit man when i wake up i feel like aids always , and the only way to fix it is take a shower so i can feel decent for 1-2 hours before the insecurity/anxiety kicks in.

i keep thinking about suicide but i know i can't do it because i can't hurt my mom like that , and i'm too much of a pussy to actually go through with it. I keep fantasizing about jumping off a large building close to my house but i know that when i'm actually there i won't be able to do it. 

I've also got dark fucking secrets i can't talk to anyone about , just think what are the five worst things some1 could hide &amp; one of those five will be what i'm hiding.

I try to better myself and control myself but i can't. Fuck dude i used to be such a sweet and pure kid but idfk what i've changed into. All i really see for myself is suffering until my mom dies so i can finally kill myself. WHAT THE FUCK KIND OF LIFE IS THIS"

I failed my college exam test to a free tuition university.. 
We have existing loans (car, house)  and it makes my parents struggle because they both got unemployed due to the pandemic. 
Everyday i wake up to the quarrels of my parents about our financial stability. 
I am so pressured to find a job instead of studying to help them. 
I feel so worthless. 
I feel like i am a failure.
I am an achiever since when i was a child
And having this failures makes me sick. 
My parents doesnt appreciate my effort instead they complain and compare me to others. 

There are no day that i think i want to kill myself
I have no friends to talk about it
Please wake me up when this pandemic ends."

2824,depression,Brain damage from long term depression?,"I have been depressed a long time since the age of 9. I'm 21 now and suffer from extreme brain fog and poor cognition and spacial awareness. It makes even simple tasks difficult and learning to drive is almost impossible even after switching to automatic. I can barely concentrate or interpret things anymore. I feel like I have some kind of learning difficulty now, I used to pick up things easily. Now I am struggling more than ever. Do you think this could be a result of the long term depression? Any of you struggle with this and have had a brain scan? Should I get a brain scan?"

2826,depression,I don‚Äôt know what to do,I wish I didn‚Äôt have to talk online. I feel horrible and I just want to physically  talk to someone who actually cares  and maybe even hug them for a few minutes. I feel pointless and find joy in nothing anymore. at just 15 I feel I have nothing left to do in life and don‚Äôt want to continue. In 2017 my grandma who I spent my whole life with everyday passed of cancer and I haven‚Äôt been anywhere close to remotely happy since. Then about a year ago now my best friend growing up that  passed in a car crash that also liked 3 others and that definitely didn‚Äôt help any. I never had many friends to begin with and none were really that close. I am ‚Äúhappy‚Äù when I‚Äôm around others but I‚Äôve inadvertently distanced myself from everyone so I can‚Äôt even fake being happy anymore. I‚Äôm down to my last friend who when I talk to I hate more and more because he just doesn‚Äôt care And I kind of feel like I‚Äôm just used as a gaming bud who helps him get free things from me in games after I stop playing. But I really don‚Äôt want to be 100% lonely so I keep talking. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt make new friends because I‚Äôm the ugly ‚Äúweird‚Äù kid that no one wants to be caught near and I find online friendships pointless because I can‚Äôt actually make connections with people. I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself anymore.
2827,depression,My anxiety is fucking with me,"I overthink everything. I‚Äôm scared of making a mistake. I constantly want to please people that i over think my actions. I‚Äôm terrified of the thought of someone abandoning me or wanting to stop being associated with me because of something I‚Äôm doing that is annoying without realizing. 

I have ADHD and chronic depression and it‚Äôs hard to read cues and read situations correctly sometimes. 
Especially when you‚Äôre naturally annoying and have a constant voice inside your head telling you you aren‚Äôt good enough. 
I‚Äôve been able to alter my behaviors to a point, but if I don‚Äôt pay attention to what I‚Äôm doing or how I‚Äôm responding to something or someone, if I truly be myself, people won‚Äôt like me. 
I‚Äôve been told all my life to be act differently. 
To be normal. 
To stop fidgeting. 
To not be myself because I‚Äôm hard to deal with. 
I‚Äôm trying. I‚Äôm trying my best. I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore. 

I hate how my brain works. I hate it here inside my head."
2828,depression,The Door Always Closes,"It very east to shut me out, I am disposable. This has happened to me far too often in my life. I am discarded, its part of who I am at this point. The door always closes on me and its like I am supposed to get used to this feeling."
2829,depression,I honestly don't think I know what it's like to TRULY be happy,"Sure I see funny things sometimes and laugh at the joke, but I don't think that's happiness. I just want to wake up and live my life feeling like I have a purpose, like I matter, I just want to be glad to be alive."
2830,depression,Just needed to vent,"I think the first time I ever actually felt real depression was when my parents split up. I was around 10 years old when that happened. My alcoholic father was in and out of jail and when he wasn‚Äôt in there he was getting coked out and drunk. He would get drunk and beat my mom and me and my younger brother could do nothing but stand bye and hide ourselves. So why did I become so depressed whenever she finally left him and took us away with her. I would fake being sick almost everyday just so I could go home from school. I would go to the bathroom and shove my fingers down my throat to throw up whatever I could just to have the excuse. That went on for so long that my mom and I had to go to court because I missed so much school. I feel so guilty looking back. Its a blur but I remember things became ok for awhile my mom found a new boyfriend and soon we moved in with him. But I believe I was like 12 when it came out that he was secretly addicted to meth which explained why some of our stuff would go missing, I assume he would pawn it more for drug money, and he was sent to a rehab center. So I would stay home to watch my brothers while my mom worked I even remember having to skip school to watch them. Not long after my mom found another boyfriend and my god he was the most manipulative piece of shit yet. I guess things were ok through middle school I had a lot of social anxiety all through my childhood I mean I would physically shake when I had to meet someone new so I never really had many friends but I was kind of forced to join football in middle school so I made some friends. But then after 8th grade we moved again and so I had to start over and my social and came back. All through high school I kind of flew under the radar. I kept my grades pretty decent and kept to myself most of the time. I do remember having many depressive episodes throughout those 4 years though. I graduated and moved in with my grandparents to go to college. I did ok the first semester but I got pretty bad my second semester. I started drinking and smoking weed every day and idk if it was to numb the pain or to try and feel something. I actually wanted to die. I felt so alone and yet I felt like I was a burden to everyone around me. I never told anyone about what I went through ever. I learned how to pretend and put this mask on that I was fine. So of course I flunked out of college that second semester and I moved in with my mom who had left that pos she had been with for 8 years and was living with the guy she‚Äôs with now who‚Äôs actually pretty great. I stayed jobless for about 6 months and I‚Äôm sure they knew I was depressed but I would cook and clean and they pushed me to get a job because well I was already 20 around that time. So I got a job at a local store and started to feel better but my coworkers were stirring up some drama and I was getting caught in the middle of it so i quit and found a job at a restaurant/bar/venue where I‚Äôve been at ever since. Honestly this job impacted me in a big way it kind of got me out of my shell and ridded me of my social anxiety. Of course I‚Äôm still pretty introverted but anyway I was still depressed off and on but like I said I would use this mask to pretend like I was ok. I had never had a girlfriend. I was just never really interested in dating anyone. I mean I had been asked out before but I would always decline and I honestly don‚Äôt understand why. But last year I decided I wanted to start dating. And after 2 rejections I decided to focus on myself for a bit longer...but then she came into my life. I‚Äôll call her Sarah. Sarah hit me like a hurricane. She made me feel a happiness I had never felt before. She made me feel love and accepted in a way that I didn‚Äôt know was possible. But like a hurricane as quickly as she came she left. We dated for a little over 3 months but Jesus those 3 months felt like a lifetime and yet it still wasn‚Äôt enough. She broke up with me in January. After that I fell into the worst depression I have ever felt. She made me feel do happy that I forgot how to pretend to do it so now everyone around me could see it. Everyone could see this monster that I had been hiding all these years. I had my mom and brothers and coworkers all worried about me and it made me feel like the biggest burden. On to of that I was feeling the loss of love. She was going through her own rough depression and suicidal thoughts which is one of the reasons she broke up with me among me being too needy. But like a fool I begged and pleaded for not days or weeks but months for her to come back. I was so bad that I made a suicide video. Obviously I didn‚Äôt go through with it but sometimes I wish I had. I was getting better until today. I found out she was with someone new and I don‚Äôt know I just broke down again. I honestly want her to be happy with or  without me but does it make me selfish to still wish it was me that she was holding and saying I love you to. Am I just holding onto what she made me feel or is it because she was literally my first everything? Do I really love her or do I just love what she made me feel? I‚Äôm not gonna bother her anymore I mean I know that much she blocked me on everything recently which I assume is because she doesn‚Äôt want me to see who shes with and I don‚Äôt mind that I really don‚Äôt. I mean we never really even talked about anything the last thing she text me was about me not getting involved because I had told her family she had tried to kill herself and to look after her because she didn‚Äôt think anyone cared about her. I know shes pissed off at me because of that but I was scared for her she was suicidal and I just wanted her to be alive. She said that she told me that in confidence and now she couldn‚Äôt trust me. But it wasn‚Äôt even about trust at that point. I don‚Äôt know. Anyways that was back in February and the last thing she said to me was that I never should‚Äôve gotten involved and that was like 2 months ago. Shes with someone new and I know I can‚Äôt be with anyone right now. I need to find myself and I hope maybe who shes with now can try and help her like I wish I could have. And if not she knows I will always be here for her. Anyways just a rant I cant afford a therapist and I don‚Äôt have a best friend to talk to about stuff thats been on my mind so if you read this thanks for listening."
2831,depression,If someone pull a gun at my head I will RESPECTFULLY ASKED THEM TO PULL THE TRIGGER.,Am not even joking. I wanna leave this disastrous WORLD like NOW.

2836,depression,The worst part about actually having ambitions is when you feel like they're completely out of reach,"I've seen a lot of people here who say that they just have no motivation, no ambition, no goals in life, no reason to live, they just want it to be over. I don't think I'm like that, I want to be like all those other kids who have lots of friends and a good social life. I want to have a job that makes me happy, I want to be successful, I want to make my parents proud, and I want to put in the work to do it.

But somehow, despite all the effort I've put in over the past decade and a half of my life, it just feels like it's all for nothing, like I'm going nowhere and the world just doesn't want me to succeed. I try so, so hard to be outgoing and have people like me but somehow I still don't have anybody asking me how I'm doing, wondering how my day went, checking up on me. It feels like people don't notice me, like my efforts to stand out as the compassionate, interesting person I am are just completely overlooked no matter WHO it is.

And at the end of the day I'm just left feeling sad. Just... My mind is in turmoil coming to the realization that no matter how hard I try to change myself for the better, the universe doesn't want it to happen. Whatever greater power is out there must really fucking hate me for some reason cause besides all logic: I'm still alone, and sad, and all around disappointed in the life I have for myself.

I just want my efforts to not be for nothing, I just want to feel like I'm even coming close to fulfilling my dreams of being the ideal, happy, loved guy that I want so desperately to be"
2837,depression,"""You're not alone""","  Does anyone else get annoyed when people tell you ""you're not alone""  like..its comforting for sure when you read a comment or a post and realize that you're not the only one feeling these things. Like cool, there's other people in the world going through the same emotional rollercoaster as me. But in the end it doesn't really help knowing that, because you're still physically alone. And even if you weren't, if those people feeling the same as you were with you..it wouldn't help. You'd just both be sitting there...struggling. 

  I dont know if any of that makes sense. I just saw a post and someone said it and for some reason it set me off. I just had to get it off my chest. Thanks for reading...if anyone did."

2839,depression,I know this sounds stupid but,"I just got scammed in a game I play. It's not my favourite game but it's what I'm playing the most right now. And now I'm pissed. I'm beyond pissed. I spent night and day working hard and for fucking nothing. I'm nothing but nice to people in that game and look where the fuck it got me. The guy who scammed me, I was nice to him and I got scammed. Fuck this. Fuck it so much. I worked so hard on it. I can't even pin point why I'm upset, but I'm upset. I'm fucking crying and shaking right now. I wanna scream. Fuck him so fucking much, I want to wish him to burn in Hell, but even through all that I still somehow have it in my heart to not wish that on someone. Christ now I feel sad and depressed again. I got suicidal thoughts now (I'm not gonna though), which I haven't had in forever. And I genuinely wanna fucking self harm now. I feel like a fucking idiot. I am a fucking idiot. The stuff I got scammed, I know I can get it back. But I'm just so upset how foolish I was. I'm so nice to people, and that's what I fucking get. Parallel of real life too, huh? Fuck it. Done being nice. Fuck people. Everyone sucks no matter if it's in real life or a game. I don't have friends, I can't make friends, especially not at this current time with school being out and corona. Not that I even had any. That game was how I socialised with people. It might seem like just a video game but it means so much more to me. 

On my cake day too. Let's mark the exact one year of this alt account being made with fucking hating myself, because what a better way to celebrate? Might as well pour myself a fucking drink to celebrate while I'm at it. Heh. I might do exactly that. 

I know this is entitled as all hell. Some lame ass 16 year old complaining about some dumbass game while people got real problems, I know. Sorry. Just wish I wasn't such a fucking idiot."

I fantasize about my skeleton sitting by a tree, just covered in moss. If I am to leave this world that way, at least I'll be of some use to something.

2843,depression,Does anyone else feel like a failure all the time?,[removed]
2844,depression,I drank myself into depression,"Firstly I'd like to say as hard as it may seem, try not to abuse drugs as it only delays dealing the root of your problem. I've done so much drugs that I've almost forgotten the reality of why I started in the first place. At that point, it's just a never ending loop that is so difficult to break. 

I thought I was doing fine since covid happened. About a month before that I had broken up with my girlfriend of 4 years and truly in my mind believed that I was completely fine. What a stupid thing to think in post. I had abused alcohol quite a bit just as my roommate was. Im just having fun drinking, right? No harm done. Every day we drank till we nearly passed out. A party of music and fun. I'd wake up and walk my hangover off and get to work. Every day, all through the shut down and well after things began to open. My ex called me one night 3 months ago, I was nearly passed out and she told me she was feeling ill mentally and asked me what should she do. I told her a lot of things that didn't work for people on this subreddit but to be honest, I told her I couldn't help her. I didn't know what to do since at that point I knew I was fucked up myself and didn't feel like I could help someone if I couldn't even save myself, I told her talk to her sister or maybe a professional and completely ignored her. Once I eventually got out of that apartment, all my emotions flooded back to me and I had a realization of just how shitty I was living my life by staying in bed all day drinking and deeply hurting thinking how I turned down the person who loved me at some point. Depression gave me an impression that being numb was being cured, that feeling nothing was good as I wasnt hurting. Anyone who's had their heart broken knows that a breakup should hurt badly, I needed to feel it but ran instead and lost what I considered to be the one that got away. I messaged her a while back asking if she's okay now but never got a response, but its okay as I came to terms with taking responsibility for my mistakes."
2845,depression,I‚Äôm not feeling so well right now...(venting),Before I have an anxiety attack I need to vent I been fine these 2 days I been on vacation with my sister but I feel so hopeless right now I‚Äôm getting these flashbacks that I had forgotten about that are kinda taking a toll on me. My therapist is somewhat helping. I still have this pain in my heart that doesn‚Äôt go away. The people ( family )  they are staying with me and my sister and everyone is asleep but me. I just got over crying in the restroom and I don‚Äôt know what to do I feel like self harming and leaving without letting anyone know. My thoughts feel out of control right now. I feel alone and extremely depressed and scared I‚Äôm not sure why scared but I feel it. I took some medication that should help me sleep. I feel lost. I‚Äôm not sure where this was going like I said my thoughts are everywhere right now.
2846,depression,I slipped a little,I was walking up the stairs but at the top it was wet and I didn't notice so I slipped and fell on my leg. I got very angry but after some while the pain kicked in and I got so happy to finally feel something now after 2-3 minutes it's healing and it doesn't hurt anymore unless I touch it but it feels warm. Idk what to say. I realized pain feels nice sometimes.

2848,depression,Progress isn't linear.,"Recently relapsed back into depression after a couple good months. Was fighting it, but that made it worse, so am now being gentle and reminding myself that this is temporary. Had a thought today in the kitchen (actually cooking for the first time in a fortnight), that ""Ugh, I was doing so well...what happened? How long am I going to be like this? Yeah, I'm proud of myself for the little wins, but...what about all the other things I'm 'supposed' to be improving on...""
Then, my brain automatically chimed in with ""Progress isn't linear"". I instantly felt less shame/guilt about my poor-coping slip ups, and gave myself a mental pat on the head for the stuff I HAVE managed. 
Yay."

2851,depression,Today 7th July 2020 is my last day on earth,"It's been a great journey guys. I am 15 years old but i just don't want to continue myself anymore. I have my birthday next month 2nd august but i know it won't be anything special. My dad rarely wishes  me and beats me every other week. My mother is even more violent and beats me like a punching bag because i am not good in academics. I don't have any siblings or REAL friends so I feel lonely most of the time. My addictions rule my life and I have no motivation to work hard anymore. I just don't understand the point of life. We work hard in school, get into a college, work in a shitty 9-5 job, get married, have kids, just to die one day. This human life is full of suffering and i have had enough of it

Goodbye everyone I will be committing suicide tonight"
2852,depression,I have so much to say and nothing to say at the same time,"Once in a while, I will think of posting here in order to vent or get things off my chest. I think of laying bare all of the pain that is held deep inside me. But the thought never sticks for very long. The whole idea just seems too exhausting in the end.

What is there to say at this point? I've been to therapists before. A few people know of my problems. I experience crashing fatigue. I experience brain fog. I struggle to work or to think clearly. I feel like a shell of a person most days. A lot of people probably think it's all in my head. I know at least a part of it is in my head. It's been this way for years. But what does it matter?

Given that their seems to be some sort of physical cause in play, I feel like all I can do right now is to continue buying time until I can eventually figure out what it is. Is it a disorder? Is it something I'm eating? I've already tried so many things at this point, but there are still so many possibilities out there. I want to talk of the pain buried deep within, but all it can do is help me live to fight another day. 

It's not that I've given up or don't know where to turn. All I can do is keep trying: keep visiting doctors, keep improving my habits, keep trying to push myself forward and put together something resembling a life. I'm not entirely unconfident or unintelligent. I can generally get by just barely. And through my own stubbornness, I've managed to accomplish some things over the last few years, including a little business.

Still, what is the point when I've sacrificed the great people in my life due to this unrelenting pain? When I've hid myself from the world because I tried to do what I thought was the smart, prudent thing in taking care of myself instead of continuing to hurt those around me? And yet now I am, predictably, left with no shortage of regrets while a solution remains as elusive as ever. But would things have been any different if I had chosen another path? It feels like every decision I can make is inevitably the wrong one.

Maybe it's just the brain chemicals talking tonight. Or, as it turns out, maybe I did have a little something to say this time haha. I don't know. All I know is that I'm sick of it all and wish I could live the life I've always dreamed of and worked so hard for. For every 100% I put in, I feel like I only get 10% back.

But I guess I will be waiting a while longer still. To endure is to struggle. And it's still a struggle I'm willing to endure."

Something happens, and I get stuck in a hole of just fucking horrible thoughts about myself and my life. Don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm trying to say honestly. Just needed to talk I  suppose. Just feels like this feeling is never-ending."
2855,depression,Depressed because i smoke weed or I smoke weed because I‚Äôm depressed ??,I can‚Äôt pinpoint how weed affects my depression. A year after smoking I became very depressed. But there are many other factors that contribute toward my depression. I wonder how weed impacts my mental issues.
2856,depression,"Parents mad at me for ""not wanting to be apart of this family""","Im in my early teenage years. I stay up late, talk with friends 24/7, love social media, like watching TV with my family, very different political views than them, and I sleep till 10, I dont go outside much(Im the only who wears a mask and social distances btw), Im a very stressed out person, and Im very introverted with giant social anxiety(I cant order a sandwich without studdering and my heart racing). My mom randomly came into my room after I went downstairs to ask them if dinner happened yet (theyre gone 60% percent of the day and I cant cook so I never get to eat a proper meal) And they said ""That happened a few hours ago dude"" Me being super pissed but not trying to show it grabbed a protein shake out of the fridge and went up stairs to go back to watching youtube and my mom comes in and says ""We need to talk"". Knowing this wasnt gonna be good I paused the video and listened to her say thay I dont wanna be apart of this family, that they never see me, I sleep too late, my brother is better than me, I dont do anything good and etc everything to degrade me. I told her than shes gone most of the day so I cant eat (Two days ago she took the whole family out for the coolest breakfest ever KNOWING I was already awake.), I told her she seems mad and uninterested when I try to talk to her, I told her that Its summer so Im staying up late, I told her I wasnt happy, and I told her I love her but she never seems to love me back so I dont try to engage with her often. She says she'll talk more about it in the morning and left. After that I cried and now Idk what to say to her in the morning. Times like these when I feel like they randomly degrade me make me wanna die. I cant wait to go to my dads tommorrow, I feel like hes the only one I can talk to."
2857,depression,depression replaced by anger,"Over the last 3 months or so, due to quarantine, my depression has lessened extremely. I used to post often in this group and read the check-in thread regularly. However, I have become filled with seething resentment and anger towards my father and my graduate advisor. I'm 40 years old, and it's been 14 years since I finished my PhD. So, obviously I have some ""daddy issues"". Could someone point me to a group dealing with resentment and anger issues? I know therapy could help, but I've had trouble finding competent therapists where I live."
2858,depression,Feeling super isolated,"Obviously everyone is right now. Quarantine sucks. But as someone with serious depression I feel like the isolation is absolutely killing me. Like I‚Äôm stuck at home with just my parents and being around them for long periods of time just makes me feel like I‚Äôm a disappointment and not meeting their expectations l. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm normally hanging out with friends all the time, but it being only them who I get to talk to is just making me hate myself more and more. That‚Äôs anything new, but I just feel like I‚Äôm falling deeper into a hole I can‚Äôt escape. It‚Äôs also making my adhd worse so getting work done is become near impossible, at least in any kind of time efficient way. I‚Äôm bad at reaching out to people and I always worry I‚Äôm a bother and people don‚Äôt want to talk to me or I annoy them and so I feel like I‚Äôm just slipping further and further into this spiral of feeling alone all the time. It‚Äôs just killing me and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore."
2859,depression,Feeling isolated and alone,"I keep trying to reach out to those who I think care and I rarely get a response. Right now, I feel as if i am in a small capsule floating through space. Alone in a vast nothing. And my head is in a terrible place. I keep wondering if I just disappeared would I even be missed. Even my own S.O. is MIA (we're long distance). I just feel alone. I hate this feeling. And I can't stop crying. I feel like I don't matter at all."

2861,depression,Am I depressed? I hope not,"Last time my bf said that I‚Äôm depressed. I mean idk, is wanting to die and feeling like a worthless piece of shit equivalent of being depressed? Is self harming also a thing that people do when they‚Äôre depressed? I genuinely don‚Äôt know. Is wanting to cry every single day equivalent of being sad or depressed? I don‚Äôt know. 

Maybe I‚Äôm dumb for asking these types of questions but I just scared. I have no reason to be sad most of the time. 

I‚Äôve also been to 2 therapists and they never said I‚Äôm depressed. They just said I‚Äôm anxious or smth I don‚Äôt know. But I don‚Äôt know anything about me since I got angry and left every time I go to a therapist..

My family could care less what steps I take. My own girlfriend tells me on a regular basis how shitty of a person I am... I don‚Äôt understand... why am I still here? What is my purpose? I breathe this air with no reason. I blink and wake up everyday without a purpose. I‚Äôm 21 turning 22 next month with no desire to even live. My life is in shambles. Covid is kicking me down everyday... I‚Äôm worthless. I just wish I wasn‚Äôt such a pussy and could pull that trigger... I wish last month during the riots I went and bought that pistol.

I also have sleep apnea which is horrible on its own but anyway, I have quetiapine to help me sleep and it helps alot escape this reality. The only problem is that it knocks the crap out of me I can sleep up to 14 hours and feel like a zombie after waking up or just not get quality sleep at all ( I dont have a cpap machine ) Here im a loser with no friends and nobody wanting me around and in my dreams i can be anybody or anything. I have tried to commit suicide in the past and I am recieving Counselling for some mental health problems it just sucks that I wish I could be amongst real people without feeling overwelmed or having the thoughts that everyone is thinking negativly about me. I also wish that I could have a job but even with being self employed in the past and having diplomas nobody wants to give me a chance.

Ive been out of school for a little over a year now. I've done many things that most depressed people wouldn't do. But I still feel the same. I have a desire to one day kill myself. Life is boring and disappointing most the time. The good moments don't feel very worth it. There are no more significant milestones in my life with school being over and no ambitions. So is this just how i will feel until I die?"
2878,depression,First post,I'm 16 years old and the only child left on the family farm. Recently I have been become continually more stressed and depressed. My parents have a genuine problem with work load. I have even talked to them about how I feel and yet they don't give me any slack and starting to make me feel a million times worse.

2879,depression,Why are people romanticize depression and think of it has a personality trait,"I just don‚Äôt get why people would want to think of depression as an esthetic. Wouldn‚Äôt this just make you think depression makes you ‚Äúedgy and different‚Äù and make you lie to yourself ‚Äúeverything‚Äôs okay this is just who I am?‚Äù

I just don‚Äôt understand why people would want to romanticize being lonely and hating yourself all the time and just wanting to disappear."
2880,depression,Bottled up my whole life,"My entire life, I have never spoken to anyone about my feelings or mental health. Being vulnerable was, and still is, such a foreign concept to me that I feel sick even trying to mention just a fraction of how I feel to somebody. I‚Äôve always put on a facade of seeming normal and okay, but I can‚Äôt do it anymore. The fact that I‚Äôm seeking help on Reddit makes me feel like even more of a jackass, but maybe I can get some advice from some like-minded individuals. I know that listening to other people‚Äôs problems can be hard, especially when a lot of us have our own issues to deal with, but if you have a second, it‚Äôs always appreciated.

Over the past 2 or so years, I have felt myself deteriorating mentally more and more each day. Like my will to live drains with each passing hour. I can easily say that the last time I felt happy or excited was over 8 years ago, and the last time I cried was over 5 years ago. Video games, Nature, history, music, passions of mine since I was in kindergarten, no longer mean anything to me anymore. All I feel is numbness. I have no reaction or care for anything, and I can go from feeling completely neutral to suicidal within minutes. I feel like such a failure to my mother, the greatest and kindness person I have ever known. Even when she brings me gifts like food, clothes, games, all I can muster is a weak, disingenuous smile. I can see the disappointment in her face. She wants a son that‚Äôs happy and reacts to things. She wants a son that smiles for photos. She wants a son that will have conversations with her, not the lifeless husk that is me. 

My father, arguably the most manipulative and disgusting person I have come to know, does not help the situation at all. Since as far back as I can remember, it‚Äôs been criticism, vicious beatings, threats, and torture. I remember losing teeth when I was younger after being hit in the face by him over a game of toy soldiers. Not only this, but he would viciously beat my brother in front of me for minor things (such as grades, saying the wrong thing, etc). Chairs, brooms, pots, pans, fists, boots, it didn‚Äôt matter to him what he beat us with. One day, after my brother misbehaved in school, my father threatened to put rat poison in our food without us knowing. Sometimes he would lock my brother and I in a pitch-black room without dinner simply because he didn‚Äôt feel like dealing with us until my mother would come home. Even to this day, I am still spoken to as if I‚Äôm a child, CONSTANT CRITICISM about everything, putting/taking food on my plate as if I‚Äôm 5, threatening to storm into my job and get me fired, shit-talking my mother and her family, calling me lazy despite the fact I work 45+ hours a week, bipolar mood swings over the smallest issues, guilt-tripping, the list goes on. 

Since I am usually always at work during the day, this leaves me with plenty of time to think. I think about how tired I am all the time, how I spend all of my willpower just dragging myself out of bed in the morning, how much better off things would be if I just blasted my head open with a shotgun. How fucking numb I feel to EVERYTHING. How I can‚Äôt hold a conversation with anyone, even lifelong friends, because even talking just drains me mentally. I don‚Äôt have the drive to move on  anymore and frankly I don‚Äôt want to. I have no plans for the future because I simply do not care, and hopefully one day I can muster up the courage to end it all. 

Probably gonna end up deleting this later, because like I said, being vulnerable like this makes me feel weak and sick."

2884,depression,I wish I could go back time and give 7 years old me a hug,"I'm currently having vivid flashbacks of traumatic events that happened years ago and have no way to stop them.
I remembered my mother telling me to ""stop talking about suicide all the time because it's annoying"" and ignoring me despite walking on my self harm attempts. My dad used to beat the shit out of me all the time and I'm still scared of him to this day. She never did anything and actually uses those events to shut me up.

My only wish was to have a happy loving family and it never happened. I'm trying to make the most out of it, to forgive and be patient, to talk things out, to scream, insult back and defend myself but it doesn't work, nothing ever worked

For a few weeks now I've been feeling tired and ready to go, only just graduated high school and I think I've had my fill of life.

Can't really remember when it got bad. Lotta things didn't work out the way they did, little things that started to snowball so Im just stuck.

2886,depression,Buying food for no reason,"Since I‚Äôve moved into my own place, I‚Äôve bought a lot of fast food. I get it while I‚Äôm on my way home and most of the time I‚Äôm not hungry at all. I think maybe it‚Äôs just for comfort because I feel more depressed and it helps me not think about it. Depression sucks and eating food that‚Äôll only make me gain weight and make me feel even more shitty about myself is not going to make things better. I‚Äôve even cooked at home so that way I don‚Äôt have the urge to eat out but I still do. 

Moving by myself was supposed to help me work on myself. Become an independent women and all I‚Äôve done is sit on my ass and eat McDonald‚Äôs. Why is it so damn hard to just do something good for myself. This isn‚Äôt the life I want."

2890,depression,I expect way too much of myself,"I put myself up to near impossible standards, and I expect nothing less than perfection of myself. If I‚Äôm not the best, or if I don‚Äôt meet my own expectations at a task, than I‚Äôm no better than someone who‚Äôs never done it before. I like to draw, and I want to work for Cartoon Network or something and make good cartoons, but I‚Äôm scared. I haven‚Äôt had time to draw in a while, and since drawing is a perishable skill, I‚Äôve near forgotten how to do it. I need practice. But every time I put my pencil to paper, my mental picture just doesn‚Äôt translate well. Everything I make is disgusting and shouldn‚Äôt be called art. I can‚Äôt even get anything down without erasing it by this stupid, idiotic logic. I‚Äôm scared that if I don‚Äôt get my act together before I graduate, I‚Äôll have to pursue a different career. I have no idea what to do. Sorry for the long read, I‚Äôd like some suggestions or something, but i think I just needed to get this out."

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs even depression but I‚Äôm an edgy teen so I guess I‚Äôll go with it 
It‚Äôs undiagnosed so I‚Äôm probably just sad and should go with it.
I don‚Äôt really want to die but I tell myself I do so I can have an excuse.

2892,depression,I hate myself. Why wont my mind stop?,"It seems like small posts to random people who dont know me is better then actually talking to people who say they care. Even if I get few responses it feels like the few people who do understand better then the people in my life. When I open up to people in my life they leave me. It's always my fault. What's wrong with me? Will I ever be someone who can keep someone in their life? Or will I always have to bottle these emotions to a point that I break? I'm honestly glad nobody I know reads this...

I dont want to tell them they arent good enough becasue that will only push them furthur away from me. Though they dont help me. They know how to I explicitly tell them what helps what would make me happy or in a better mood but they do what they want to do...I cant blame them for my mistakes though. I have no one to blame except myself...

I've recently lost 2 people who are important to me. They were the only people I talked to more than once a month. I dont feel like I have anybody I can go to when I feel broken who will hold me and tell me it's going to be okay. I'm alone. Now anyway. It's always my fault. I hate myself constantly and I feel like I need to punish myself for pushing them away or for them wanting to leave me. 

I am nothing. I am nobody. I am empty.

Why cant I be someone who people want to keep in their life? Haha I want to bash my head on a wall or scratch my arm again to the point of scars. I want to cut I want to drown myself, choke myself, just HARM myself. I dont deserve happiness I deserve pain for how I treat people and how nobody wants to stay with me. 

I hate myself so much why wont my mind shut up. Please just be quiet. Why cant it empty? Why arent I good enough? Why cant I die without hurting people? Why cant I have just never have been born? Why am I me?"

2894,depression,Story tell me what you think," I wrote this a few years ago I sometimes write when I don't know how to express or just don't know why I feel a certain way and I just can't bring myself to read what I wrote again although I do remember the gist of it but i felt like putting it out into the world. So here goes nothing: Girl in the Mirror 
When I walk by I see a figure staring at me that looks very familiar Someone I maybe used to know I walk towards them and they begin to insult me and tell me how worless and useless I am. I look around wondering if anyone else can see this person but there is no one there and the insults keep coming . You are a stupid motherfucker who will never achieve anything in this world, anything and everything you do will never be worth it no matter how hard you try, your life is pointless why are you still even here, the people you know don't even care what the fuck happens to you. If you disappear it'll be just like you were never hear and everyone will move on as always with no worries in their mind while you are standing here starring at a mirror and listening to the voice inside your head that no one else can hear tearing yourself apart not even being able to recognize yourself in the mirror you think its an entirely different human being. Look at the person in the mirror and tell them to fuck of because you know you're better than them. Don't let me win, let you win. The person that is standing there is worth so much more than you know. My job is to belittle and break you but it's up to you to decide if you'll listen or walk away and find the person you truly want to be."
2895,depression,I ran into this scene on youtube,[removed]
2896,depression,Getting left for girlfriend/vent,"A couple hours ago I was having a great time with one of my few friends. I've never been a ""gamer"" but due to corona my friends got me into it and into discord. So anyway we were playing Total War Shogun 2 for a couple hours, then he said he had to run a quick errand. We talked while he was going, he lives 2 minutes from a gas station but he wouldn't tell me what he was getting. He got back and we played for a little bit longer but I could tell he was distracted. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then he told me his girlfriend got to his house. I'm friends with her so it wasn't a big deal but I knew we weren't going to talk for much longer. When he said his gf got there I got so sad. We talked for a bit and had one last battle. They tried to make me feel like I wasn't getting in the way of anything and tried talking to me longer than they should have. Then he said he should get going. I agreed, I don't dispute or ridicule when my friends ditch me to be with their gfs. I would do the same if I had one. 

&amp;#x200B;

I left the discord call and just sat there, depression starting to swell. I wasn't expecting to feel this tonight, I thought we would've played till 2 like usual and I go right to bed so I can avoid the loneliness. I realized why he had to abruptly run an errand, he was getting condoms. I started to imagine what it would be like to have a gf. To have a girl in your room. I don't think I even know the half of it. All the small details of feeling wanted or loved I'll never know. I don't feel anger towards him or anything. I don't know what I feel except so sad I can't begin to place why. I should be grateful that he spent time with me in the first place. I will just never be truly happy. I have this dangerous mindset that if I ever got a gf my depression would finally be cured. But I know it's not that easy or magical. I'll probably be doomed to this for my life. Never having a gf isn't nearly the only cause of my depression don't worry. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sit here now trying to occupy the time by writing this out. I am so depressed. I've been depressed for years. I could have a great day with my friends but when I get home alone I forget about it. It seems I get depressed at the drop of a hat. I hate it. I can't pull myself out of it. No matter how good a day I have the depression comes for me regardless. I don't have any self esteem. I hate myself, I'll be alone the rest of my life. No hope. I hate this feeling it's so deep in me. I'm not doing this for much longer. But I guess I do have some small hope that's why I'm trying to give myself some more time. I just can't handle all this pain. I don't want to feel like this anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a mess, stupid, and kinda pointless I'm sorry. I just wrote this to occupy myself."

I survived my first semester of college with decent grades but it drained the life out of me and I don't want to do this for the next four years let alone two years. In addition, all my anxious thoughts, insecurities, and mistakes keep haunting me especially during quarantine and everything going on in the news isn't helping.

2903,depression,Remembering the past hurts.,"I often find myself discarding and erasing any traces of my past, and then spending the rest of the day feeling terrible about it. I've had bad experiences in the past like anyone else, but it's the good experiences that I constantly find myself trying to forget. 
  
  
I just really hate remembering the good moments because I hate remembering that I used to be happy. Before adulthood and all of its complexities, there were moments when I was carefree, and little things (like eating a favorite food or watching a TV show that I used to like) were more than enough to make my day. There were times when all I needed to be happy was a good book or a full night's sleep instead of a cocktail of various pills and energy drinks. 
  
  
There was a time when I was still myself, and not the fragile, broken person that I've become. Now, any traces of the old me are painful, and completely ruin my day. The old me has been dead for ages, and even remembering her is torturous. I would rather forget that she ever existed, and get by with ""good enoughs"", like when the pills are actually enough to get me through the day, or when I still have enough energy to clean my room or have a home-cooked meal. I hope that doesnt sound too dramatic. That's genuinely how I live, and I'm just trying to make the most of it."

I‚Äôve been dating her for 5 months and everything has been going great but tonight she left to go to a party with some friends and it‚Äôs actually making my heart hurt. I told her that my heart is hurting because she is sneaking out but she went and did it anyways. She is saying she needs to feed her wild side and that she won‚Äôt do anything stupid like cheat on me or anything like that. I‚Äôve been cheated one in the other 5 relationships I‚Äôve had so I feel like it‚Äôs just going to happen again. She says she loves me but I‚Äôm starting to doubt it now that she isn‚Äôt caring that her sneaking out of her parents house is hurting me. I can tell I‚Äôm starting to get depressed again. If there is anyone out there that could help me with this I would appreciate it.
2906,depression,I just hate life in general,"I just don't like nor care for life or this world. Reality is just so boring. I can't find a single interesting thing in this world, everything is just plain and mediocre at best. I have nothing that i want, no ambitions or dreams or desires, everything is just feels so unexciting. I feel like there's nothing in this world worthy putting effort into since the outcome is always so unsatisfying. 

I can't comprehend how other humans are fine living like this. How is anyone content with having countless boring responsibilities everyday and worrying about pointless things while believing that some short term dopamine hits are worth this constant suffering."

2911,depression,Looking for answers,"I came on Reddit to find answers and just search deeper into my own emotions and feelings. I've had different situations occur to me throughout my life and no one would think I have, I walk around with a fake smile. constantly attacking myself over the slightest things. Currently, I'm struggling with the idea of having a direction or focus. everything around me seems so give or take. I push in a good direction, I get pulled back. everything lately has seemed so neutral and I feel as if I'm struggling to keep myself in place. Every day is the same routine due to different aspects that have affected my life over time, with not many ways to fix it. I know it's okay to not be okay. if someones ask what's wrong I don't have an answer, I'm just lost. I'm not looking for specific answers, I'm looking for things others have looked to, for a direction or just some uplifting each day. Some routine breakers and just some personal opinions.

2915,depression,Help,"depression runs in my family, and I had a terrible year last year dealing with suicidal thoughts and things like that but I‚Äôve gotten completely over it, went to therapy even though it didn‚Äôt help. I learned to push things away, thoughts that make me question life. But now it‚Äôs really hard to be sad. I can feel all my other normal emotions, but I spent so much time practicing not crying and not being sad that I can hardly be sad even when I want to. Like right now I feel like I need to cry but I can‚Äôt. Whenever something happens in my life that could be bad I just push it away and distract myself, and it‚Äôs been working. But I know it‚Äôs healthy to be sad. I have also lost interest in drawing and animation, which I used to invest almost all my time in. I‚Äôm still interested in other things though. I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm starting to get depression, but I really don‚Äôt want to take medicine, I have been diagnosed with adhd, and have tried many medications for it, they all turned out badly. I also probably have anxiety but like I said, I learned to push things away so that they don‚Äôt bother me. What should I do?"

2917,depression,I'm losing my will.,"I'm completely new here, didn't really want to post anything, but I'm kind of desperate at this point. 

I'm not even sure if I have depression either, but I do get random breakdowns from a trivial reason; it's probably a buildup of what was happening.

My parents moved me from school to school frequently, and I lose friends as well as the ability to be social as it progresses. Once I'm shipped abroad to the US, it gets even harder. My friends speak a different language from me (Chinese), and they would constantly chat without me understanding. I've asked them sometimes, and they often don't tell me at all. It's a daily ordeal, to the point that I barely even exist in the group. Thus, I don't consider them as my friends; they're assistants I would say. Once there's no school, we basically do not have any attachment at all.

I got a boyfriend after a year. He's loving, almost too much. I wonder what I did to deserve all of those ""You're amazing"" phrases; I was simply doing homework the entire day while with him. I didn't do anything for him. Sometimes I felt that he's too touchy or needy and would think I'm a victim under his control, but once I searched for signs online... the signs of a controlling, toxic, and narcissistic person would assimilate to me more. I do not verbally or physically abuse him, but my seclusiveness(?) makes me uncomfortable whenever his friends are near us and talk to him. I never told him anything, but he notices and starts to spend more time with me and less with them. Isn't it toxic? Why can't he tone his love down?

Now that quarantine and summer are here, I'm trying to let go of him. He's having fun with others now, which is good for him. But now I have nobody. I'm far away from home. A relative took me in, but the husband for some reason does not like me. I do not feel welcome in here. I know there are too many problems, that's why I don't know what to do. I'm stressed, pathetic, every possible negative thing in one. The only thing that has barely pulled me out of these low episodes is my goal to grow up one day and repay my parents for the money they've spent on me. But now... even that is not helping. My life is so dull, and people either do not want my company or are badly influenced by me. I cannot find one thing to look forward to tomorrow. After a storm comes a rainbow, right? Then where is it?"
2918,depression,I feel like people meet me and think I‚Äôm chill then they get to know me and get dissapointed,"I just feel like a terrible person with terrible motives and behavior. I just don‚Äôt understand why people want to be around me and I genuinely feel like none of my friends like me and talk about me behind my back. I hate this feeling, I was doing really well and felt genuinely happy and then randomly depression just hit me like a truck. I remember the exact moment when it hit me, I was chilling just eating breakfast and then a moment later I was like fuck, it‚Äôs back."
2919,depression,I feel like I've got another mental health problem but I really don't want to self diagnose.,"I'm diagnosed BPD and depression, but in light of today's events I feel like I might have NPD too. I feel like I'm going to spiral again because people in my life are happy."
2920,depression,"Just got diagnosed last month. I mean, I knew that there was something wrong with me in the last four fucking years. I'm glad I know what it is now.",[removed]
2921,depression,Fear of judgment,"I feel like I always say the wrong thing, like every word that comes out of me is fundamentally flawed and not ok. I feel like when I post on reddit my thoughts are just unacceptable to other people. There‚Äôs no evidence of it, I just assume. I don‚Äôt really know how to conform. I don‚Äôt have malevolent intentions but I just feel like people can get offended by anything. I feel like people have extra sensory abilities to judge others as bad and wrong. Why can‚Äôt people just be open and understand each other? I understand that people interpret meaning subjectively but it just makes me feel very constricted. I guess communicating through words isn‚Äôt always going to be interpreted as you expect. Maybe people like to take their negative emotions out on other people and I‚Äôm afraid to be one of those people. Maybe I should just delete reddit to avoid potential ridicule."
2922,depression,Those days where your whole body feels numb and floaty,"I was having a pretty usual night until I had a slight disagreement with a friend and it was fine at first but when I went to bed my social anxiety kicked in. The thoughts that I need to push everyone away kept me up so I went to scroll social media. I opened Twitter which was a big mistake because a really graphic sh pic showed up on my tl. Idk why because I don't look at that and although I don't usually get triggered by things online, this really upset me. I didn't sleep. I just feel so flat in my whole body. I plan on eating and existing until later so I can fall asleep early tonight. 
If anyone actually reads this thanks and sorry"
2923,depression,Utopia,"I can‚Äôt do this anymore. I could sleep forever at this point. To close my eyes and be at peace is all I want. But that‚Äôs impossible. I know it‚Äôs selfish but deep down I want be ignorant. 

I wish I didn‚Äôt know the horrors of the world and how terrible reality is. I wish I didn‚Äôt realize how cruel humans are. I wish I could do more. I wish I had the energy to do more than lay in bed. Most of all, I wish for this overwhelming guilt and anxiety to go away. It‚Äôs just feeds into my depression. I‚Äôm disgusted in myself for wishing all these things because truthfully I deserve it. I deserve to suffer the consequences and fix the corrupt world that my ancestors created. I know I am privileged yet I feel so useless because I cannot do enough to help those without it. Sure I sign every petition I come across but I can‚Äôt bring myself to protest and stand with my friends, neighbors, and strangers who are hurting the most. Large crowds cause anxiety spikes and my senses to overload and I end up having a panic attack. 

I know all of my wishes from before will never come true but if there was one thing I want most in the world would be peace. No more senseless death. No more murder. No more innocent people wounded or killed. No more racism. No more prejudice. No more assaults. No more stealing. No more brutality. 

My utopia will never happen in the real world but maybe just maybe when I close my eyes to eternally sleep I‚Äôll see a world with love and peace. A world with everything I‚Äôve ever wished for. 

One day, I‚Äôll see my utopia."

2926,depression,I'm the reason why my mom isn't successful.,"My mom isn't a narcissist, I want to preface this post by saying that. She didn't make me feel this way, I made me feel this way.  

I'm 22 years old. My mom gave birth to me 9 months after graduation; and I'm paying my dues because I'm the reason she isn't what she wants to be in life. 

She wanted to be a professional musician, play French horn for orchestras around the world. My birth snuffed that dream, like a freshly lit candle. She couldn't go to college for music for very long because of me. My biological father left us before I could even walk or talk. We moved around a lot when I was younger, and she had a hard time finding love because I was a shithead kid. When I was in 2nd through 4th grade she was dating a man that abused me and her. He made her do vile things that I can only imagine how they haunt her now. I learned about the side I was ignorant of when I was moving out for work, at about 18. It wasn't until I was in 8th grade she met her husband, my stepdad. They had my half sister when I was 16. To their surprise she was healthy and everything was okay. I was not. I alienated her because she'd get a 'normal' upbringing; lessons learned from my mistakes wouldn't happen again. She's been lucky, I was not as lucky. 

How am I paying my dues? Atoning for the sin I committed by being born? By being who I am now. 
I'm awkward. Growing up I had a hard time making friends. One of the psychological reports I read in my medical record from when I was in behavioral therapy was; ""makes friends with younger kids because it's easy for him"" another I read was ""socially reclusive"" a few years later. As a 22 year old now I'm called ""fucking weird"", ""strange"", and ""the kind of person who grew up torturing small animals."" The latter I would never do nor have done; being known as that hurts me more than I can describe.
I'm paying my dues by being unable to make friends, to keep the few friends I have been able to make, to experience the human condition, to love. 

I want to be accepted, I want to be loved by people who aren't required to love me, I want to have friends that care for me as I do them. 
I hate being dejected, pushed out of a social circle, being called weird, and unwelcome. It's just something I have to come to terms with sooner rather than later.


If you read this far, thank you. I don't expect this to be very visible or well read. I wish my mom knew how sorry I am for my existence."
2927,depression,Tragedy,"As of now very few WW2 veterans are alive today, especially German WW2 veterans. Nobody truly appreciates the scale of war, manpower, destruction. Ignorants surrounded by media, pop culture and only to call nazi when they see a German veteran.

 Nobody cares or tries to understand the loss of men at stalingrad and Eastern front. Memories of WW2 vets are fading with them and no one fucking cares. Its nothing more than another chapter in history for these people. 
Imagine living a life as German soldier, the already bloody war at eastern front and incoming attack from west, you are constantly fighting, no time rest, its been years since you've seen your home for the last time. Once a victorious war machine, now surrounded by enemies. 
No time to relax, fighting day and night, having to see your comrades torn apart before your eyes, always retreating and surrounded.
There's not a single reason to be happy, you can't even cry; you got no time to cry anyway. 
Lost all territores from west to east, millions of lives wasted for.. what?
They're now planning a attack on Germany itself, little to no hope but you still fight to a bitter end. 

All this to be called a Nazi and seen as ""bad guy"". Nobody really appreciates your sacrifice. 75 years later only to get called Nazi again by some random fuckhead on internet.

And yet this isn't the only tragic thing. It is that, We're losing WW2 veterans faster than ever. They are dying quickly. I will never be able to shake hands with any WW2 veteran, its killing me from inside.

2928,depression,Is there really purpose in life?,"I don‚Äôt think who I am matters but recently I‚Äôve been just thinking about life. Why does life have to be unfair and cruel?

I just feel trapped and I can‚Äôt shake the feeling off even when around friends. I don‚Äôt know what will make me feel better. Maybe I want to start a new life probably go to Canada or something but that‚Äôs only a fever dream. I can never do that so I‚Äôm trapped here. Wasting my life with jealously and envy.

Then there‚Äôs a lot of posts talking to the entire white demographic saying how they‚Äôre privileged. I am not fucking privileged man. Every aspect of my life, my stutter has seethed into and made it harder and more heartbreaking.

I‚Äôve feel constantly attacked for my sins and like I‚Äôll never be good enough for anything, anyone, even God if I can‚Äôt accept everything the Bible say. I‚Äôve been going to a church where I recommitted to God and learned a lot, but that has also very much hurt me, refused to listen or have a real conversation, and most recently has made me want to leave the faith completely. It seems that I have no where to turn, I don‚Äôt want to call a help line rn cause I have too much anxiety to even speak words right now and I am in so much emotional pain.

2933,depression,Do I want to die or not?,"I don't think I've ever been so confused on how I feel. The last 4 years for me have been a huge struggle, with mental healing and twice as much mental damage. I'm clinically diagnosed with Bipolar depression, general anxiety and PTSD (and don'tget me wrong I'vedealt with this far before this time in my life.) Within the last 4 years ive had my mother choose an abusive man over me, got us evicted from our home overnight and had to move in with a friend whose family I had only met once prior. My father completely cut me off and blame me for the death of my grandmother (we didn't get along so he figured I wanted her to die.) And within this time get into my first serious relationship where I was dumped twice, the first time, the day before a foot surgery that left me unable to walk for 7 months. The second time, the end of last year, a month after our 2 year anniversary, with his ex girlfriend. I had only found out because a mutual friend sent me the screenshots and hotel receipts. Needless to say I stayed.. I have no where to go, no one to talk to and no family to ""burden"". Within these last 4 years I have felt so absolutely worthless and depressed but I'm also so scared of dying. When I get a bad depressive episode I feel like I could finally pull through but I'm too scared to do it, what if it gets better? It's not just relationships and daddy issues, it's  all of the feelings of self loathing, guilt, and worthlessness that has been brought up from it. I just don't know where to go from here.

And I‚Äôm praying that I don‚Äôt have it. 

My immune system isn‚Äôt the best and it could take me longer to recover than a healthy person.

And I have seen healthy people‚Äôs bodies become destroyed by it.

It is said likely that athletes who contract the virus likely won‚Äôt be able to compete in their sport anymore. I‚Äôm a dancer and it is my whole life, if I have to give that up I won‚Äôt have much else to live for. 

It‚Äôs likely I‚Äôm being a hypochondriac, but I‚Äôve admittedly not been as careful as I should be. Yes, I wear a mask when I go out, I wash my hands and use hand sanitizer frequently, but I haven‚Äôt been diligent about not touching items in stores too much and I have always been one to touch my face a lot and it‚Äôs a habit I can‚Äôt seem to break.

Let's start with my background.
I am 21M, currently in college. I recently joined my Intern under a reputed MnC. Since I am Indian, this indeed counts as a big deal in our society. Everyone is happy apart from me. I don't feel anything. I don't like the work, I don't like the company, I don't like the environment. I don't even want to continue my education sometimes. I just stare at void, and try to find meaning. I don't feel like there is a meaning to anything at all. Like anything. The world is going through crisis, and people are suffering, and but deep down we know, it's just a phase and everything will be back to normal, and I am afraid of it. I don't want to return to the normal world, and move on with life. The next thing on my already established plan is finding a job, and I already dread it. I don't want it but I cannot say this to anyone. Everyone I have ever talked about this has offered me advice to atleast give it a try, but I don't want to. I also have this insecurity, that if I don't achieve something ""good"" in my life, I will waste my life, and my families expectations. I just want to face the world any more. All I want to be in the little corner of my room and sleep. Sleep and dream. Because as soon as I open my eyes, things become meaningless.

TL;DR : Don't know what I want with life. Don't want to face the world after quarantine. Don't want to interact with anyone in real world, while simultaneously wanting to escape everything."
2949,depression,Why would anyone like me,"I can't even get anyone to be my friend let alone have someone love me. 

I invited people over for drinks and no one came. I think it's because no one really wants to be around me, why would they tbh."
2950,depression,Most horrible month in mu life and it will get worse tomorrow or turesday,"Last year my life was going downwards in every way and the climax came when i failed bachelors degree, i ve been drinking alot and sitting in depression, but wa hoping that this year i will make it, but tommorw i will get the results and i have horrible feeling that i fucked up again, if so i dont know what to do, kill myself or move to other country and start life from the scratch. I feel dead inside and that i let down everyone around me, especialky my lecturers. I migh be a retard and i dont want to live anymore, every year its only bad things happening to me and nothing good. Im in dar place."
2951,depression,I‚Äôm desperately in love with my best friend.,"I‚Äôm desperately in love with my best friend of 6 years, she means the world to me but has made it clear that she wants nothing to do with me if it‚Äôs anything more than a friend. She‚Äôs one of the main reasons I‚Äôm even still alive, she has been there for me at my lowest and Vice versa, I helped her through her mother‚Äôs early death due to a genetic disease that she also has. I‚Äôve been he shoulder she cried on when idiot dudes broke  her heart, I‚Äôve even held her close in the night to keep her warm when we went camping. She‚Äôs the perfect person for me and my best friend but she wants nothing to do with me. She‚Äôs the only one I really have and the main reason I‚Äôm still alive. I‚Äôm also alone despite having her and my family. It feels like I‚Äôll never be about for anyone when she knows me to my core and doesn‚Äôt want me. She‚Äôs helped me try and get other girl friends to no avail, one ex even committed suicide after leaving me. Does anybody else have this feeling too? I let seems certain I‚Äôll end up alone and stay by her side for ever regardless."
2952,depression,Started to cry.,"I asked my little brother (21) I‚Äôm (26) what symbol he would say represents him if he had that symbol and he sent me a picture. I didn‚Äôt know what it was and I was trying to figure it out. After bugging him he told me what it meant, and he said ‚Äú it‚Äôs the symbol of depression ‚Äú and I said are you really depressed and he said yeah I am. And I just started crying. I do so much for that kid I treat him like my son. And I just want him to know how proud I am of a brother and that I love him and he knows that. But I want someone else to show it. I want more people to give this kid a chance and be a true friend someone you can count on. If anyone is depressed you aren‚Äôt alone."
2953,depression,Should i call the suicide prevention hotline,"Ive been thinking about killing myself lately I already know when and how im going to do it, but im not sure if I could go through with it. I deserve it ive done so many bad things in my life things that can't be forgiven. And ive been feeling empty like something is missing in my life like nothing in my life will get better. I feel invisible when im around people and just want a friend or someone to hug. I just want to feel something other then this numbness."
2954,depression,My fault,"I‚Äôve spent years of my life being depressed. I grew up in a household with a schizophrenic mother and she was very unsteady for most of my childhood. It took its toll on me. It was very upsetting to see someone go down such a path like that. Especially at such a young age it was brutal because I loved my mom more than anyone. I felt terrible during this time and it lead to me becoming depressed. I moved on to high school and began to hide these problems under alcohol and weed. During this time I spent trying to get with girls and trying to become popular just so my life seemed normal, so I seemed normal to myself. I found a girl my senior year of high school and I fell in love with her and I was able to talk to her. I was able to be myself and be happy and talk about these problems that had haunted me for years. Me and her had our ups and downs. I had bad bouts of depression and bad anxiety. As we kept dating I felt less and less that I could talk to her and I began to hold everything in. I became severely depressed and everyday was another fight to be myself. We soon both moved on to college and we went to different schools. This put a really bad strain on our relationship. We broke up soon after and I made a mistake. I had sex with one of her close friends. We were both very drunk and we said we didn‚Äôt want to talk about it or tell my ex. After this I fell into a deep depression and had constant panic attacks and began to fall deeper and deeper into my depression and myself. I became severely depressed and introverted. I wasn‚Äôt able to talk to people and I stopped going to class and talking to close friends. My ex came to my school for one weekend and saw each other at a party and began to talk again and she came back to my place and we started back dating. We ended up being okay and at the time we really needed each other. We kept dating for a while. I hid the fact that I had sex with her best friend. It took a terrible toll on me and I knew I couldn‚Äôt fully love her and be a good boyfriend without telling her the truth. Recently I did and she of course broke up with me. The last 2 weeks of my life have been hell due to it. I‚Äôve begun heavily drinking and have started using cocaine and marijuana to try to hide it all. I can‚Äôt eat without becoming nauseated because I‚Äôve been drinking so heavily. Being alone is terrifying because I can‚Äôt think about what I did to a person I loved so much. I can‚Äôt deal with the fact I hurt the person I loved so much. I don‚Äôt want to be depressed like this I don‚Äôt want to have to face my reality. I don‚Äôt know what I hope to gain from writing this. I don‚Äôt know what to do I feel like I‚Äôm staring insurmountable wall."
2955,depression,I'm not ok,"I don't even know where to start. 2020 has been nothing but a shitshow. Since February I have:

-Lost my job
-Moved to a different country suddenly due to coronavirus and I miss it terribly (I can't go back because of coronavirus, Americans are currently not allowed in)
- Contracted an STD from a lying ex (thankfully it was treated but still)
-Put up with going from being an independent adult to being stuck in my parents' house temporarily. They are both also depressed for different reasons and we agree on nothing politically or religiously. 
Things came to a head two days ago and my mother called me a bitch because of my political opinion on Facebook and told me to leave. I spent the night at my cousin's house and am now back at my parents' until the 14th when I will move to a ideal but acceptable place to get away. 
-Started talking to a guy who acted interested in me romantically but was lying. We ended up having sex without a condom so now I have to worry about STDs again until I get tested

Despite being 31 years old, I constantly seek male validation and commit the same errors over and over, allowing myself to be used and hurt by men. I'm an only child, my parents are old, and I desperately want a relationship and assurance that I won't be alone. 

This fear is what led me to keep talking to the lying, cheating ex who wasted 2 years of my life because I guess being abused is less scary than being alone. I just now blocked him after he made me cry and I hate the fact that I'm burning a bridge.

Men don't want a depressed woman and I don't blame them. So I keep accepting short-term attention from men who just want sex even though that's not what I want because that's probably all I can get.

I know I will have my own apartment soon and I'm starting a new job in two weeks, but I don't feel excited. I feel utterly hopeless, tired, and wishing I had never been born. Everyone in my family is fighting due to the current political tension. I don't know what to do. 

I suppose I need counseling to address my unhealthy focus on men/relationships and everything else, but I've never had any luck with therapy in the past.

I was taking antidepressants for the past ten years or so off and on. I am currently not on them and don't relish the thought of having to take them forever.

Thank you for reading."
2956,depression,I dont deserve a good life,"For reference, I'm 21F Indian expat living in the middle east. 

I feel so inadequate despite having all the necessities. I have a roof over my head. I have food in the fridge. I have gaming devices, a smartphone and a really good laptop to do programming with. Yet, I feel so inadequate. Yesterday, I sat down to meditate in order to ponder what has been bothering me these past few months. These are the moments that open the floodgates of tears:

1. I didn't have a good childhood. Not in the physical or emotional sense but in the social sense. As my name suggests, I'm a tomboy that didn't get along with the other girls in class during middle school (this is a gender segregated school for reference). In elementary school, I was a massive cry baby over small instances like my socks being the wrong color, my skirt was too tight. I also felt entitled over having friends and would complain to my teacher if someone didn't become my friend. The problem was that I had OCD. In middle-school I developed crippling social-anxiety.
2. I fucked up my high school years. Till the 10th grade, I was able to cruise through classes without any effort. Everyone praised me, I was smart and intelligent. Then I couldn't understand a lot of the 11th and 12th grade material and I ended up getting a 75/100 in the 12th grade, a large change from my 98/100 10th grade. My world crashed. I was told that I had a high IQ and all that. I didn't study for my finals because I was so stressed with exam anxiety. I was scared to put in the effort to study because I thought I wouldn't get a high grade because in actuality I was stupid and not intelligent.
3. I didn't do much in college even when I could have. I was focused on getting a 9+ CGPA (out of 10) as a way of redeeming my 12th grade marks. I focused a lot on classes and attending lots of clubs which eventually broke me. At the end of it, I got my 9+ CGPA but I barely did programming outside of classes. I feel so ashamed trying to do basic programming tutorials now when I should be doing big projects. I look at some of peers getting into BIG 4 companies. They're smart. Have CGPAs bigger than mine and have impressive projects. I feel like I can never catch up to them. I'm paralyzed everytime I open the code editor.
4. I over-promised on projects and on my thesis, didn't deliver and begged my way to finishing it. My most recent and embarrassing experience is that I did 3 projects (in machine learning) during my bachelors and I over-promised on all three to my advisors because I didn't want to disappoint them. My thesis advisor threatened to drop me because I was unable to fulfill the promises that I first made. They kept me and I was able to finish it and I still work with them now. I'm so ashamed of it still after 6 months and I still can't sleep over it.
5. I was supposed to go abroad for grad school (masters) this Fall but the covid has put that on pause. I've been dropping into periods of depression. I sleep all day. I can't type a line of code because I'm paralyzed by it being too simple and not a huge ass revolutionary project. I realized that I barely know the proper math in my preferred field (machine learning). I thought that I could use the gap well and study for it in preparation for research. But I'm so scared of putting in the effort and failing. I got into a good grad program but I fall into depression when I see my peer get into a higher ranked program. ""That could have been me. I didn't try hard enough. Why didn't I try a bit harder? Because I thought that my skills weren't good. Why didn't I try to improve my skills? Well somebody can do the job better than me. Why should I try and disappoint myself by failing? I could do it but I'm scared to put in that effort."" 

My depressive episodes can be summarized into the following ""I'm not somebody special. I'm not Steve Jobs or Albert Einstein. My peers can fill the role of 'special'. So why should I bother trying when someone else can do it. I might end up failing and falling to the ground. I don't deserve to even exist. I'm not as smart as I thought. I'm afraid of putting in the effort to make myself better.""

Thanks for reading till here."
2957,depression,Back on my bullshit,"Tl;dr: I had bad depression for a while, had a relatively depression-free period of about 6 months, and am now feeling hopeless and depressed again. It sucks.

I guess I just need to talk, I havent talked about anything in a while. I feel like maybe I should go to therapy again, but at the same time that idea scares me. What if I cant find a good fit? What if I do, and then they get a new job; like all my therapists before?

But anyway

This all started when I was 12, I started feeling very angry and/or sad all the time. I had voices in my head that would constantly be saying bad things to me about my worth and tell me lies about how people around me perceived me. I was very paranoid and scared of the world, I didnt have many friends at school because I just didnt talk to anyone. I was so insecure that I just assumed they wouldnt like me. I did also get picked on a bit, so that definitely didnt help.

Sorry I'm rambling. I didnt know what was going on with me, I thought maybe I was schizoaffective, bpd, bipolar, or something else (I was a young teenager, give me a break for thinking this). But I didnt know. I just thought I was crazy. I kept it all mostly to myself with very few exceptions, out of fear of being thrown into a mental hospital or being told something I didnt want to hear

Eventually I did find my way to therapy (after 3 and a half years suffering largely alone) and it helped. A lot. I'm very thankful that I had the opportunity to go. Over time, a period of about 4 more years, and after meeting somebody great whom I love very much; for the first time I could remember I felt happy. Genuinely happy.

We live together, he's the perfect boyfriend, we have 2 cats who I love very much. I have a job, that I hate, but I'm grateful to have a job. My life has relatively low stress, honestly. We make enough to pay our bills, my job sucks but it is easy, I dont have family drama right now or anything. So why am i suddenly slipping again?

I know it must be related to what's going on in the world, of course. But I worry. I just worry so much. I've been doing so well and I worry that if I fall hard now, who knows how long it will take me to get back up? 

What if me having a meltdown ruins my relationship? I love my boyfriend so much, we havent been together for very long though so he hasn't really seen this depressed side of me (a little over a year, we kinda had to rush into moving in together due to extreme circumstances, but like I said it's been great). I think that he would understand and be there for me the best he could, I just worry because when I get sad, he gets sad as well.

He starts saying that he feels bad that he cant make me feel better, and that he feels like a bad boyfriend because I'm sad. I've told him so many times how happy he makes me, that he's the best guy I've ever been with and he treats me so well, I have no complaints. He says he knows.

I just, I dont know what to do. I cant talk to him about it without feeling guilty, i dont want to make him sad. I'm terrified to go to therapy again and once again be thrust in to a new search as soon as I get comfortable with one. 

I just needed to get some shit out of my head I guess, thanks for listening if you did."
2958,depression,I always seem to get cheated on no matter what,"I have been cheated on 3 times. Right as I get attached to my partner, she either breaks up with me or cheats on me. I know that this is nothing out of the ordinary compared to a lot of other things people go through, but it still hurts.
This recent relationship I was in, I was infatuated with her, and I thought she loved me back, but later I found out that she cheated on me. Five days after my birthday she broke up with me. A few days after that, I heard from a friend of hers that she cheated on me. I never found out about it when I was in the relationship, but I was still sad about our relationship ending when I learned. She cheated on me with her ex. They ‚Äúhung out‚Äù every weekend. One time me, her, and her friend were on FaceTime and her friend mentioned the guy, and my gf panicked and basically told her friend to be quiet right in front of me, I was suspicious, but I didn‚Äôt want to be annoying and say that she can‚Äôt have any guy friends. This time it was really depressing, I thought she was different. I felt something special with her. I‚Äôve been cheated on many times, I feel like I‚Äôm doing something wrong. Am I mistreating them. I don‚Äôt abuse them, I don‚Äôt insult them, I feel like I‚Äôm pretty nice to them. This is only one of the reasons I feel depressed. I hate to say this, but I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with depression by a doctor. No one knows that I have depression. But I‚Äôm pretty sure I have it. I promise I‚Äôm not one of those ‚Äúfake depression‚Äù people. I don‚Äôt think anyone that I know personally would care if I said I think I have depression. I‚Äôm sorry if this was too long to read, I just wanna vent somewhere. I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk too. If you did read this, then thank you, I really do appreciate it."
2959,depression,"So apparently my brother has ""Catatonic Schizophrenia"" and idk how to process it..",I don't really know how to take it in.. It's making me lose my own mind thinking about it tbh. I just want to know if anyone has ever gone thru something like this. I can't explain the pain it feels like. He's currently admitted.
2960,depression,I want to be not sober/not me/ or asleep at this point,Stuck in this limbo of nothingness
2961,depression,"Just trying to put a smile on people's faces just goes...badly, i shouldnt be here, nobody wants me here"," Its  amazing the lengths a few people have gone to ruin my life, ive tried  to be a good uplifting guy, at my job there has been someone to actively  make an effort to ruin my reputation, in my personal life my neighbor  to air out my personal life to everyone and anyone , everywhere i turn i  overhear shit talking about me, i hear all of it....i'm so tired of  trying to be the positive guy...i just want to make people around me  happy but people seemingly fight against my good attitude...i literally  had a peer of mine talk terribly about me for everything i did, worst  part of it all is the guy he talked to was my boss and my companies hr  rep...i dont want to be here anymore, i hurt...despite all my attempts  at bettering myself and actively working to better my environments there  is always someone to seeming work against me... i was fired  unexpectedly from my last job and spent about 6 months homeless..my  current job ive already seen someone to nitpick everything about me,  saying I'm a weird guy and why did we hire him...what's wrong with me."

2963,depression,So this is about me I guess,Just to start off if my grammar is horrendous then I'm sorry I have dyslexia and sometimes mess up a ton. So I'm adam and today I'm gonna type up everything on my chest okay. So since I was born I never felt like i was like by my father or mother. My dad would drink alot and my mum would pick fights with my dad and it would be me as a child having to then cope with my father's anger as he would lash out and attack me. So when I turned 17 my dad did a DNA test and it turns out he wasnt my father this was my dream as a kid as he was a douche. But at this time he and my mum where divorced and he was a changed man. I was 16 when I first started taking anti depressants and I'm know 25 and still taking them. Yeah I'm sorry this is long but still. I also hate the way I look too I've never felt good enough for anyone and never feel like I will. I just feel alone alot of the time and well I've been taken to hospital after having a overdose and just life is just hard I guess theres plenty more about my life I'll post one day too

2965,depression,Every friendship I have ends with them just using me,"Several months ago, my bestfriend of 15yrs begged me for rent and gas money and then I found out she blew it on concert tickets the same night I lent the money to her.
I never told her that I found this out. I just got really distant towards her. 

We were very close and she was like my sister at one point. Then our relationship devolved into her only contacting me when she wanted something from me. Always spins some sob story or makes herself look like a victim before asking me for money. 
It's just unbelievable what an entitled and lying piece of shit she is.
She messaged me out of the blue recently to tell me she can't pay the penalty for keeping a dog hidden from her landlord. Well tough fucking shit!

Honestly, every friendship I have seems to end with them taking advantage of me. Do I just have a knack for attracting scumbags?

 I'm so lonely and tired of this life. The only person I truly care about now is my mother and when she's gone someday, I'll have no reason to go on."
2966,depression,.,"idk how to describe this, but do u ever just feel okay/numb and then u just get random suicidal thoughts? or even just bursts of sadness along with intense chest pain and the need to cry?"
2967,depression,I keep breaking down and I dont think I'm strong enough,"I (17f) worry so much about how my depression effects my loved ones, my boyfriend (17m) in particular. He said to me recently that he feels he doesnt make me happy and I dont know what to do. I love him so much and he does make me happy but I cabt be happy.

I really want to be happy every time I'm with him because I want to show him how much he does for me by just being mine but I can't. I feel so hopeless.

I break down almost every day, and it really hurts me. I'm also an addict, addicted to opioids, tramadol in particular. I would rather be numb and happy some, rather than just feeling pathetic and weak all the time. 

I hate the way I am, I have tried killing myself but I just cant, I know people will grieve for me, I'll be ruining some peoples lives. It feels wrong. My boyfriend worries about me killing myself, I wish he didnt have to. 

I dont expect much from making this post, I expect nothing. I just thought, after making my post about my addiction before, that I should also come to terms with the effect I have on the people around me. The people I love.

I love them so much, I just cant show it"
2968,depression,PIZZA!,"Guys!!! I made pizza!!! From scratch!!!!!! This sounds small and whatnot but I haven't been eating ""real"" food for a bit and have been trying to skip most dinners but today I decided to make pizza and it looks really good!!!

Pineapple on pizza is amazing too if you say otherwise then please, don't comment on it"
2969,depression,my lover‚Äôs friend died,"and although my heart goes to him and I feel sad about it, especially because my lover donated blood to him just last week, but I‚Äôm also jealous. jealous because his friend is dead and I‚Äôm alive. I‚Äôm been on the brink of suicide for months, but I‚Äôm too cowardly. his friend is gone just like that, but I remain. and...I think I‚Äôm also jealous because he cares so much for the loss of his friend, and that‚Äôs the kind of care I‚Äôve always wanted to feel. he‚Äôs of course sad, taking the day for himself and dealing with the tragedy, and it just makes me wish i could receive that type of caring and loving. if I ever did kill myself, it would suck because then I‚Äôd never be able to see that *anyone* actually cares. I hate being alive and I‚Äôm jealous that his friend is dead. I know this sounds super scummy and selfish, and this isn‚Äôt a good reflection of who I really am, but I guess deep down this is a part of me."
2970,depression,I'm completely exhausted and seriously considering suicide.,"Earlier, it used to be flashing vivid images of me slitting my wrists. But now it is an organised thought. Yesterday, I even decided to write my letter. It gets worse everyday and I just can't cope. The worst thing about depression is that it will almost never kill you. So this terrible pain will continue and perhaps grow stronger. I'm hopeless and just want all of this to end."

2974,depression,I wish the world was different,"I feel so much despair and hopeless regarding the state of humanity. People will choose to see themselves as good above everything. They will justify the cruelty they conduct by telling themselves ‚Äúthey deserved it‚Äù. All of the prejudices and separation in the world makes me feel really, really sad. It hurts that many men perceive women as animated objects who‚Äôs only value is her sexuality. Sorry if it‚Äôs controversial to say such a thing but it‚Äôs just so depressing. I hate that people judge another person negativity based on the colour of their skin, their appearance, age, sexual orientation, culture, socio-economic status or income. I hate how people are so superficial and ignorant. It‚Äôs really awful when people don‚Äôt even love their own children. One day everyone on earth will have empathy and compassion, if not hopefully we go extinct soon. I know I‚Äôm just some nobody with mainstream opinions but there‚Äôs just so much pain and injustice in the world and I can‚Äôt do anything about it. I just want to protect all of the innocent people and children before they are exposed to the cruelty this world exhibits. I want to create a utopia for all the sensitive and kind hearted people. I can‚Äôt stop feeling all of this pain. I feel like apologising on behalf of other people‚Äôs behaviour and choices. I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm sorry life as a human isn‚Äôt what you expected as a child, I‚Äôm sorry you had to be exposed to this world. I‚Äôm sorry to all of the animals who are exploited and treated with such cruelty.

2979,depression,Diabetes and depression,"For the past three years I've been progressively caring less and less about my diabetes. I've not been so far gone to try to take my life or anything but I haven't been happy in years. Everyday I wake up I'm sore, tired, weak, I feel hallow I don't enjoy my job, I feel as though my life has been in a stalemate I haven't progressed at all in my life in three years. I'm not a open person my girlfriend is amazing she tries to be understanding for my situation but I won't let her in and it takes a toll on her and that hurts me too because I love her. I don't understand why I've been so stagnant in my life for the past three years I have no goals I don't care about anything I wake up go to work hate it go home play video games and rinse repeat the only time I ever feel a shred of happiness is playing games and I'm only happy if I'm performing well in them other than that I'm mad at myself for playing poorly for what I don't know, I have trouble communicating how I'm feeling I can't say it out loud I physically can't I change the subject but when it has anything to do about how I'm feeling and I'm just so lost I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know if it's depression or what I've tried to tell my endocrinologist because they ask you ""how often do you feel bad""? That whole questionare and I said that I think I might be depressed and they basically ignored it I just don't know what I'm supposed to do who or how I'm supposed to talk to someone so I can progress in my life I'm just so lost.

Sorry for the text wall just don't know what to do.
I'm a 24M living at home, not really trying to talk to my parents about this just seems like another complicated situation to add to my already rubix cube of issues."

And I don‚Äôt really have the money for a family lawyer. So I‚Äôm here in hopes of finding a new life and a better way of income to actually settle this dispute. It‚Äôs been really mentally rough on me. And my old therapist didn‚Äôt help much. And I‚Äôm a bit anti-social. So I hate trying to explain myself to friends and family. I hope this is a good place to share. And I look forward to hearing your stories. Anyway, I just wanted to vent a little and introduce myself. Hope everyone gets a little more happiness than yesterday."

2987,depression,Sometimes you just need one thing,"I'm sitting here talking to friends and family members, just trying to get someone to admit they are here for me. I just need to hear it, or at least be shown it. There are other things going on but they can't help with them, I just need someone to act like they care and talk to me about it even if they have no advice. But no one will. Either they aren't responding or they just say oh it'll be ok or some other vague nonspecific commentary. I just need something concrete. Some message with actual effort put into it. I just feel alone and right now it seems like I really *am* alone. So I came here."
2988,depression,Why do I feel the way I do? Why do I have to hide who I am? Why me? Why us? Why???,"I just don't get it! All I wish in this life is to be a ""normal"" person for one second. Just so I know what it's like not living with fucking depression. People don't know it, but I am severely depressed and lonely.

On the exterior, people think I'm just a normal guy, but what they don't know is I'm 36 without a girlfriend or family or anything meaningful. I have an okay job, but, again, this God damn depression and the cocktail of drugs I'm taking are making me forgetful and losing myself. On top of all these heavy weights bearing down on me, life decided to take my only source of solace and comfort in my dog--whom I loved with all my heart--in a car accident. So fucking cruel! And it seems like everything I touch turns to shit. Can I have a moment of the Midas touch? Please? 

Fuck you, depression and anxiety! Fuck you!  You've robbed me of life! I'm staring at becoming 40 without anything to show for it. I'm staring at life blankly. I'm staring at a reflection of who I am not. Why me? Why?!?!?! Fuck!!! Argh!!!!!"

I failed thesis again for the 4th time and I'm seriously considering killing myself. I know well enough it's my fault that I didn't pass and it's because I don't believe in myself at all, I had no motivation I always end the day thinking I wish I was just dead and it would be better if someone else replaced me and because of that I don't get any work done I wish I could've just had someone to talk about it with and my parents won't bother because all they just say is ""Its just like this"" or ""I've gone through that too"", Me dead? Its not gonna affect the world at all just the people I'm close to, if I had any. I'm not smart, I've been bullied so much for being stupid when I was so young I was convinced anything I do is stupid,I have no talent and in these 6 years of college I only got carried, I got what I deserved. I'm still at the starting line and my friends have all reached the finish line, they all graduated and have careers. I just wish I didn't exist at all maybe everyone's lives would have been better"

I could watch my own damn funeral and break down because whoever tries to speak about what I went through in my last few days, months, years, would just be so full of shit because not a single damn one of them has can say they know. Not one fucking person would be able to say they reached out to me or asked how I've been doing. But they can damn sure tell you I checked on them. I dont want to look the devil in the eyes, but my will to live already died... Now I'm just fucking here."

So I can‚Äôt drag him down with me. I‚Äôd hate myself for that. I want him to be happy. I‚Äôve only been a fraud around him just to get him to talk to me but the truth is that I suck.

2993,depression,I lost all my passion and now I feel worthless,"When I started undergrad I had a path set for myself and loved what I studied. I had this passion that outweighed everything. After I transferred to a uni everything changed and I began to feel and still feel as if academia is bs. But now I have no path and I have no interest at all in what I was studying. I guess I‚Äôve been clinging onto idea and people to help get me through this but that doesn‚Äôt seem to work and I keep on getting hurt. I feel inadequate in everything I do lately, even drawing, which I love but I‚Äôm total shit. Now I feel like I‚Äôm just waisting my time away. Waiting to work a job to get an apartment and.. what? What will I ever make or do or say to leave an impact? What am I even working towards? Just existing and hoping some people I meet will give me some sense of meaning to my life?

2995,depression,Hope for The Future,"honestly, the only reason I haven't completely given up is because I'm hopeful for the future. I'm 15 now, a teenager. Life is exhausting right now. Maybe it's because of quarantine and they say that quarantine is mentally draining for those with mental illnesses.

However, I think that it's going to get better once I become an adult, when I don't have to go to school, can move out, and have the freedom to do what I want. My life in high school has been pretty average, or even below average on some days. I don't have as many close friends as others because I'm an introvert. I overthink way too much which causes my relationship with other people to become damaged. I just want to skip teenage years and turn 18. At eighteen, you're almost an adult. You don't have to deal with the pressure of school and grades anymore. You can go out on nights and actually live life. You can have your own house or even move in with your best friend. You can sleep in on weekends without your parents forcing you to get up at 9 in the morning. *You can actually live life.*

I don't know if it actually gets better or not because adults always say to treasure your childhood because you'll never get it back. But I think it would certainly be better than right now. I may be right, I may not. Only time will tell."
2996,depression,I'm an empty shell of a person,"Somewhere along the way I lost my personality. I cut of contact with extended family, stop speaking to my mom, stop hanging out with friends and just fully immersed myself in business.  

I had a great childhood, born to a high income family, and then my parents got divorced. A nasty divorce it was. 

Instead of taking the divorce like a man, my dad became self destructive and waged a war on my mom. He let our house go into foreclosure instead of finding a buyer. He spend hundereds of thousands of dollars making sure she got as little money as possible. He talked bad about her to us and he never spoke to her again even though they had 4 children together still under 18.

It's difficult to explain all the little things that changed but everything either went abruptly to shit and I didn't have time to react to it, or it went to shit very slowly and didn't realize it. 

Nevertheless I bottled everything inside and tried to remain optimistic. I went from going to a private school my whole life to going to a public school. I was actually happy to be leaving all my friends behind even though we all knew each other since preschool. I wanted to get away from everyone that knew me. 

While my dad was being self destructive I moved in with my mom and I quickly adapted to public school. Eventually making new friends, new enemies and talking to new girls. I got kicked out my first year and was transferred to another school to finish 7th grade. At that new school, I got kicked out after 2 months and missed the rest of the school year. 

I started 8th grade at a new middle school and started living with my dad after I got into a petty fight with my mom. My mom moved to another state with two of my sister's and things started to feel stable again. I met a girl in the new school and even though we were young, we were in love. Our relationship was on and off but didn't last much through us going to different high schools, me starting to do drugs and becoming emotionally unstable. 

I started going out with another girl who eventually cheated on me with my best friend while all our other friends knew which made me feel humiliated. A few weeks after that I broke my leg in a late night biking accident while I was drunk and high missing the first part of 11th grade. This is the point where I could say that I lost my personality.

My middle school girlfriend visited me in the hospital and it made me so happy to see her. After I recovered I told her that I still loved her but she was wise to see that I wasn't a stable person. It's been almost 10 years since I have been with her and I don't think I been happy since. Of the few girlfriends I had in high school, none of them made me feel the way I felt when I was with her. 

As the years went on I struggled for a long time wondering if I was in love with her or if I was in love with the thought of her. I think I still struggle with this almost 10 years later. I have dreams about her occasionally.

Anyways, my leg recovered and I went back to school but I stopped associating with most people. I felt so humiliated from breaking my leg and having my girlfriend cheat on me with my best friend while all my other friends knew. I quickly got my GED and left school in 11th grade and started working and going to community college. 

In community college, I was the best student I could be but  struggled with talking to girls and meeting new people. I became such an awkward person. In my third semester there my dad got a heart attack while at work and had to get a triple bypass. I became more depressed and used his heart attack as an excuse to leave my job,eave school and start working with him. His business at that point was a shell of what it once was before the divorce but he invented a novel item and started doing better in the market. 

At this point I was smoking weed everyday by myself or with group of friends. We were all losers so I felt comfortable hanging out with them. 

As business became better with my dad's company and I was becoming more successful, I slowly started ditching every last one of my friends. I had no more contact with my extended family and I had stopped talking to my mom. 

My entire life was literally Business, smoking weed by myself, watching Netflix, and browsing reddit. Nothing else. At some point when things got more serious with the business, I threw away my paraphernalia and stopped smoking weed. But I was already at the point of having no friends and no personality. No experiences, no dates, or anything that would resemble a social life. 

People will ask me sometimes if I have girlfriend and I get nervous and feel shitty about myself. 
 
I am 27 now, live at home with my Dad, sister, and my nephew. My sister's boyfriend works for me so I go to work and see him and my dad, then come home and see them again. 

My happiness and emotional stability is 100% tied to how business is going that day. I watch a lot of porn or use tinder to look at girls without any expectation of ever going on a date. Before the pandemic, I was going to the gym but I coudn't bring myself to talk to anyone. 

In December I randomly matched with the girl I fell in love with in middle school but all I could say was ""You look awfully familiar"" and we she responded with a pet name she had for me and a exclamation mark. I couldn't respond back. 

I am so ashamed of myself and have no confidence to even have a conversation with her when we matched on Tinder. 

No matter how much money I make I will always feel like a loser. 

I have days where I kid myself thinking everything is going to be ok and others where I become extremely depressed and wishing I would suddenly die. More and more often I think of myself in a suicidal scenario or curse myself out loud. 

I was having one of those moments before I started to write this post. I decided to write this because I don't have anyone that knows me that I could tell this too.

The other night I had a nightmare about my mom, I can't remember exactly what happened but I remember feeling like shit that I don't talk to her. She's getting old and only one of my sister's speak to her. She was such a good mom before the divorce, she did everything for me. Even after when I broke my leg she stood with me every day and helped me rehabilitate. 

My life is so mangled and I'm not emotionally strong enough to get myself out of this rut. I know I need to talk to someone but I can't bring myself to do it."
2997,depression,Are individuals with depression vocal about it?,"I‚Äôm really sorry if this might a controversial topic:

Do people with depression usually vocalize and talking about it publicly? How can you tell someone that‚Äôs faking depression (or a narcissist) from someone that‚Äôs truly diagnosed with depression?"
2998,depression,The worst part is being so unbearably sad about nothing in particular,"At least when something tragic happens you can point to it. There's a logic to it. An acceptable mourning period. It can be terrible, but it does, slowly and steadily get better as you move away from that painful event. I've experienced this.
But then there are times when I wake up and my heart just sinks into my stomach and I feel this overwhelming sense of insignificance and it just doesn't stop no matter what I do. And the tears will come for no reason, other than a deep, unexplainable sadness that makes breathing hurt. I lose my appetite and can lay in bed for hours thinking of nothing, wanting nothing but to feel ""just ok"" again. Then I feel guilty because I shouldn't be sad, especially now. I'm healthy, I have a roof over my head and food to eat, I am so very fortunate, but I'm so tired of this."
2999,depression,A poem I wrote that is still so very relevant,"It‚Äôs July and it‚Äôs getting harder to find shade from all these questions and regressions,
It‚Äôs joy and magic and summertime Chi,
I wanna live and thrive but my actions imply that I wanna die. Actions speak louder than words but right now that‚Äôs false
I think I don‚Äôt sleep because my dreams consume my mind when I‚Äôm awake, increases my pulse . 
Not always the scary kind, there‚Äôs the light that penetrates through.
It‚Äôs about balance. 
I stand on two feet when I‚Äôm not laying in bed. 
Face sunk in the pillow tryna K.O. But the engine‚Äôs runnin in my head. 
It‚Äôs hard to live in a house that was your home but then the foundation crumbled and died. 
But I got visions of my aspirations, who I want to be, I‚Äôm tryna plant my seed, water my roots and expand my being. 
It‚Äôs all about balance. 
Take what you get give it your best. I think I‚Äôm doing better than before but what if I‚Äôm still stuck in the cycle?
 I got sunshine. 
I thought the rays would help me. it‚Äôs melted the frost in my chest but what if it hasn‚Äôt put to rest  the continuous thought. 
And I got love. It oozes from my pores, people sense it like snakes, always wanna taste either my skin or my words. 
And lately I haven‚Äôt been holding the pen or the sword. 
I been grasping the nicotine just gotta suck in more
tryna get buzzed or high talkin bout i don‚Äôt know why talkin bout I could stop if I tried and I could. 
But it‚Äôs nice to feel something. 
Can‚Äôt hold nobody‚Äôs hand right now so lemme go smoke on that tree. 
I just wanna be free. 
In my body I wanna be me. 
I got all these dreams.

3007,depression,How I lost all of my friends in 2015,"I‚Äôm drunk and just confessed this story to my dad but he didn‚Äôt say anything in response which is wild bc I‚Äôve been holding it inside for 5 years. 


I was sort of dating this guy and I was really scared to commit because he was my best friend. I was stupid and thought that because we only made out when I was drunk that meant he probably wasn‚Äôt actually into me, he was just drunk. Looking back he didn‚Äôt make out with anyone else so I was probably wrong. 



I would make out with anyone who was cute and wanted to at frat parties. I drank a lot and partied a lot because I liked to feel nothing but pleasure. Being sober wasn‚Äôt my favorite. He suggested I slow my roll, I brushed it off. 



One night I was assaulted under a basement staircase at a party in the same fashion Joe Biden‚Äôs accuser claims. Look it up if you want the details I don‚Äôt like to talk about it. 


I sat outside the party crying for like twenty minutes until my friend found me and called her boyfriend to take us back to the dorms. I told my RA about it and my sort-of-boyfriend sat and held my hand while I sobbed the story out. Didn‚Äôt report it because I don‚Äôt know who he was beyond that he wearing a striped t-shirt. 



When we left my RAs room my sort-of-boyfriend aka best friend told me he didn‚Äôt want to deal with me anymore because it was too hard to watch me not care about myself as much as he cared about me. He was more popular than me and had less mental issues so all of my friends including my roommate stopped hanging out with me in favor of him. 



I tried to join some clubs after that to make friends, fencing, chocolate club, a history club. Felt like shit for missing every other meeting so I just stopped attending. Transferred schools afterwards, was assaulted three more times in the last five years, each time I was drunk. Therapists either didn‚Äôt want to talk about it or blamed me because I was drunk. 



Finally I tried to kill myself and a sexual assault advocate came to my house and talked to me. Took me until then, four years later, to stop blaming myself. Now I have a new therapist and she‚Äôs the only one who has ever made any progress with me by identifying my horrible mental cycles stemming from my religious trauma growing up. 



Can‚Äôt talk to her because I‚Äôm in a different state during this quarantine and she can‚Äôt service people outside of her state. These last two months have been a lot of reliving those experiences. I feel like shit. I wish I could have some sort of closure with my ex-sort-of-boyfriend but I don‚Äôt think that five years later he‚Äôd want to remember I exist. I sure dont."

3012,depression,My cat my beautiful son," 

My cat my beautiful son 

he lived with me since he was 2 months old 

I cared about him, loved him with all my heart all my soul

I got a cat because I was depressed (still am but even more than before) 

I got him because i thought god could repay me for caring for such a pure soul and I wasn‚Äôt close to god not praying not doing anything

a couple of days before  i noticed that he couldn‚Äôt piss properly and losing appetite i knew 2 vets i called the first one who saved my cat before from poisoning i called him told him about my cat health he told me to bring him immediately to the clinic and because of corona lockdown the clinic was already shut in my city but the other clinic was open in another city but i couldn‚Äôt go the clinic in my city was open from 10 am to 8 pm but i didn‚Äôt get him to that clinic even though all the issues were within two days but i didn‚Äôt get him there even though that i hang with my friends around that time

the next day i called the second vet he told me to feed the cat yogurt and milk cheese because what my cat had appeared to be digestion issues i did feed him he responded but still no big appetite or almost no appetite at all i left him everything he needed hoping he could get better this option was cheaper for me 

next day i decided to get him a medicine then i got to the pharmacy got him a medicine called Motinorm then i got home i gave him a spoon of the medicine then i got out . got a call from my mother telling me that the cat is throwing up weird liquids white and more then i told my mother to leave him when i‚Äôll get home i‚Äôll get him to the vet that call was on 10 pm i got home late at 7 am next day I was with my friends then i got home found him sleeping still breathing i kissed him and then i got to sleep

on 5th of May 2020 my mother woke me up telling me to check on the cat he was on the ground his eyes were open and his mouth open and his body was stiff like wood i checked him no pulse no breath 

i moved my hand across all his body like i was playing with him like he was still alive then i kissed him for the last time 

i put his body into 2 pieces of cloths and covered him then i took him to bury him 

now he‚Äôs gone i feel i‚Äôm guilty i‚Äôm the one who chosed the cheap option the easy option 

i feel great pain and grief i was already dealing with depression and ptsd and his death came upon me and cut me deep 

i feel that i killed him even though i could save him i had the time the money but i didn‚Äôt save him i visited his grave many times since his death i feel i want to take home with me sleep with me in my arms 

i don‚Äôt know what to do i was holding a knife to my throat but i stopped 

i punched the wall hard as i could with my head and my hands 

i feel my misdeed my sin 

i can‚Äôt handle living without him remembering him waiting for me coming home and being all alongside me 

i have friends i have my family but i‚Äôm alone i stay in my room alone 

don‚Äôt know what to do 

should i kill myself, should i forget, don‚Äôt know."
3013,depression,I'm Mediocre,"Mediocre is the word that sums me up best. I have no special talents or skills. Every interest I've ever had that I put effort into has either resulted in me dropping it because I got bored of it, or even after years of effort trying to be good at it has failed. 

People always say that comparing yourself to others kills your happiness but I think that's just something they say to comfort people who are mediocre. 'Run your own race'. Enough of it. For once in my life I just want to be the best person I know at something. Yet even the things I've busted my balls to be good at I'm still not good at. And I'm sick of it. 

Everyone needs to be something. Being good at stuff is what gives life meaning. It's what makes a life matter, what they can do. Yet everything that I've tried, whether it be sport, music, writing, academics, or hell even chess, I've never been THE person people think of as the best person they know at it. 

I've been born a total loser. No drive. No ambition. No secret 'calling' that the special people get in life. I'm not even well liked by people. There would be some comfort in that at least. But no, I've always been the 'friend that's just there.' No ones best friend. Not 'the funny guy' of the group. If I had been given a sense of humour, and could make people laugh I'd take it. But no, I'm just the person who happened to find themselves as part of the group and no one really hates, but no ones especially likes either. Completely mediocre. And what do you do about that?

I cut out most of my friends recently because of that. Not that they have noticed. 

I'm not good looking either. Its shallow but it does matter for self esteem. Even that though. I'm not ugly, but I'm not 'turn your head' attractive either. Completely forgettable. I'm not smart. That's something else that could have made up for everything else. Make me smart, some person who has it all together, can problem solve without anxiety, can think critically and come up with ideas and solutions. But no, even there I don't have it. Even after actively trying to make myself smarter, I'm not smart. 

What's the end package then? Some loser with no friends, no ambition, no sense of humour, average looks, isn't smart, isn't skilled or talented at any of the things he tried to be good at. What's the fucking point in me being here? I shouldn't have been born."
3014,depression,I‚Äôm so depressed I haven‚Äôt taken out my contacts in 5 days,[removed]
3015,depression,I‚Äôm so tired of everything,"Has anyone ever wanted to just disappear or completely remove their existence? Like I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever kill myself, but I wish I could just leave everything behind and start fresh. I‚Äôm saying that if I had a say, I wouldn‚Äôt have been born at all. Life kind of sucks the older you get, it seems to get worse sometimes because of the harsh reality of things that were never exposed to you as a kid. Like I feel like I‚Äôm just more and more disappointed and let down as time goes on. I also feel like all I do is just let others down somehow."
3016,depression,I‚Äôm so tired of everything.,"I don‚Äôt even know where to begin really. 

I guess I‚Äôll start with I lost my mom last September, she raised me alone and the way she passed was traumatic. I watched her die during her liver transplant surgery and I felt so helpless and like I let her down. Since then I have had panic attacks and got diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder at an urgent care. Because of this I always feel like somthing is wrong with my body or an organ. 

I also lost about 60 pounds which isn‚Äôt a bad thing I was trying to (went from 380 to now 320) but I never felt worse. I constantly feel like somthing is wrong with me. My stomach and digestive system have been a wreck for about 2 months the urgent care just says it‚Äôs Gastritis but they also found a gallstone. So I feel like I lost the weight for nothing cause now I just feel like crap every time my stomach cramps up. On and off diarrhea, gas, my stomach gurgles. Unrelated but just to add onto how much my body hates me, i get cysts or boils all around my waste especially now in the summer that are painful when they flare up. 



I‚Äôm depressed all the time and my family knows and they care but they don‚Äôt know how to help. 
I don‚Äôt really know how to help myself either. 
I‚Äôm a 25 year old man and I feel like I‚Äôm worthless waste of space with a shitty body and mind. I can‚Äôt tell anyone just how much I miss my mom and hate myself for not being to help her I honestly hate life at this point. I‚Äôm just writing this all out cause I feel like I needed to put it down somewhere other then my head. 
I know there are people who have it a lot worse then me and I have no reason to complain which makes me hate myself more. I‚Äôm not suicidal cause I‚Äôm terrified of death but I do get the thoughts every once in awhile. 

Sorry for anyone who decides to read this. I know i am rambling on if none of this makes sense sorry to put you through that."
3017,depression,I can‚Äôt keep going,I‚Äôm a senior in high school I‚Äôve bean bullied and physically and mentally abused. I want to kill myself so much often I‚Äôll wale to God begging him to kill me because I‚Äôm to much of a coward to do it myself. I just can‚Äôt keep living with the emotional pain and with the lack of joy or feelings love or loved. I want to just drive off a cliff and be done with it all.
3018,depression,Why,"Why why why do I feel this way everyday. Why is it only getting worse. Why. Why. Why

It is consuming me. I don't know how much I'll be able to still live life as usual

Why"
3019,depression,How can people be so motivated and happy,I have i blank look on my face most of the time I try to put on face that looks like I'm happy and fine. But alot of nights I cry silently so no one hears me. With this online school does not help because I'm really behind not because it's hard it's just I don't feel like doing anything I don't even want to move or talk. I've imagined alot of ways I would die most of them are suicide. I try to look for ways to get motivated but nothing works. And when I see people say stuff like don't kill yourself you have so much to live for I feal nothing it kinda makes it worse. I don't know what to do. I hate waking up so when I hear something that kinda sounds like my alarm clock is freak out a little it's like a jump scare. I have been motivated before but when I really start being productive it fades away.and I've already looked at the r/getmotivated. if you have any ideas to help please say something. And this is my first time posting
3020,depression,Just a vent I guess,"I have just realized that people don't care as much as they say they do, I always have to be the one to reach out to my friends to talk, they never reach out to me. My biological dad took every opportunity to skip out on important parts of my life, such as elementary school graduation, visits when I went in foster care, not quitting drinking when I begged him to. (His alcoholic rage fucked me up.) He even blamed some shit on me while he was in prison, so blast him to hell, still don't talk to him. 

My bake shop teacher was an asshole, made me feel uncomfortable in class, and made me rethink my dream job, everything was fine until the quarentine hit, was gonna move to hot foods, start dating, but nope, fuck you OP. Fuck you indeed OP. 

My adoptive dad always expresses some sort of minor disappointment when I play video games, the thing I wanted to do, versus reading, the thing my dad asks me to do because it is good for me. So what? I don't give two shits, I take people's orders all day at a McDonalds in quarentine, and unload a whole truck by myself cause some women at my joint don't believe in equal responsibility. I then have to close the store, cause I am too nice, and now I said yes to something that I probably should've said no to.

I don't expect any of you to care, this might not even get recognized, you probably are laughing at my problems, and that is fine. I will only just become more insecure as a result, thanks for reading Reddit, hope you fucking neckbeards enjoy this one."
3021,depression,"i dont know if o have depression, but if i do, would that mean that no one can love me?","everyone keeps telling me that i have to love myself and learn to be happy by myself and all but...i dont know, i cant, and even if i tried i just...cant

after all this quarantine shit i'll try to go and get myself diagnosed to see if i have something cause im tired

but if i do then would that mean that no one can love me? cause, everyone wants happy people, independent people, people with their life together...i dont have any of that, im not even attractive, im not even skinny...i dont really have anything

but i feel so alone...and well, i've always wanted someone to love...but if i cant be happy then can anyone even love me?

i just want to be loved too..."
3022,depression,Seeing her kills me.,"Since school has been canceled due to recent events, it's been much easier to forget about my ex. But I see pictures on social media and it pains me more than I can describe. My heart physically hurts, I feel hopeless. Although it was a decently long relationship, it's still been over six months and I can't see myself happy with another person.

 I just feel numb, I feel hopeless in humanity as a whole. Everyone simply cares for themselves, when all I wanted to do was give her everything despite what it would do to me."
3023,depression,:(,"Love when I go to sleep in an attempt to stop thinking just for my brain to say ""fuck you"" and dream about the shit I don't want to think about."
3024,depression,cant connect with anyone,"i have been suffering for the past 7 years. Going through multiple episodes and pulling myself back up again. but my childhood trauma and issues always seem to follow me around no matter how hard i try to move on and embrace that and grow from it. it doesn‚Äôt seem to work. my mind always wanders back to the lack of emotional support i had as a child and the people who betrayed me. I cant trust anyone anymore and most importantly, i cant seem to make close friends. it feels like i cant connect with anyone at all if i try to talk and find similar interests. i cannot get close to anyone. i constantly think everyone will hurt me and i shut myself out. I have been trying to talk more, smile more and be interested in other people. i feel this need to get close to them but at the same time, i am always so formal and i cant interact with them the way people my age do (i am 20 years old). 
another things that constantly bothers me is wasting away my childhood and teen years because of depression. i missed out on so much and it pains me that i am still in that cycle and everyday i live with this, is just another day I wasting away. i hate waiting for the end. i want to be happy and i want to be successful. i want to see the world but all these dreams seem hard to reach not because of the hard work but sometimes the circumstances seem to just not be in my favor. 
I hate telling people my problems and my feelings. they get uncomfortable and say the wrong things when i tell them about my suicidal thoughts. i feel like a burden to them so i hate bothering people about it. I am writing all these here on reddit cause its comforting to know that someone is reading this and hearing me."
3025,depression,I‚Äôve been depressed for years due to bullying. How do I overcome this? M(19),"When I started Highschool, I would never have imaged I‚Äôd come out of it depressed as shit and barely passing my classes. I remember it starting just before the 9th grade my friends would start to tease me. I didn‚Äôt care back then, it was stupid little jokes that really didn‚Äôt bother me. It wasn‚Äôt until midway through grade 9 that it got progressively worse. Everywhere I went, I was a source of ridicule and always the butt end of a joke from my group of friends. Still, it didn‚Äôt bother me much until the jokes would revolve my background and heritage. One instance I vividly remember I opened my locker to find pictures of my cousin, who had past away when he was 12. Then my friends surrounded me and made choking noises. Then everyone knew about it. Everyday I would hear jokes about my cousin and it pains me still to this day that they would ever make fun of a child who passed well before their time. I get that I might not be the most extroverted person out there, and I‚Äôm definitely a bit of a pushover. I just don‚Äôt like conflict and every time I stood up for myself they would just knock me down even harder. I‚Äôm still friends with some of the ex perpetrators, it‚Äôs way better now that some individuals are out of the picture and everything has pretty much stopped. But I can‚Äôt help but notice how much this has affected the way i view myself. I‚Äôve been smoking weed a lot recently due to just not wanting to feel empty anymore but it‚Äôs honestly making it worse. I just want to be happy, I‚Äôm not expecting you guys to have all the answers, mostly just wanted to vent somewhere."
3026,depression,We don‚Äôt deserve this,Don‚Äôt you guys notice that depression happens to some of the most good and kind people?
3027,depression,Life,"For a long time I wasn't sure if my sadness is depression. Even if the symptoms were present, I didn't admit it. I felt I needed a third party, specifically a therapist, to diagnose me.

Writing this post is me admitting that I have depression without a third party.

This doesn't mean I am fixing myself and working towards healing. Not really. I don't know.

I'm just tired of life. I want someone to end my life or magically fix me entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

For the most part, I like being and doing things alone since I don't have a significant other. (I rather spend time and be with my special someone.) But I have realized I am starting to get lonely and admit that I am lonely. I yearn for this special someone. I want to talk to them and be intimate with them."
3028,depression,This is the only reddit group I get notifications for. THE ONLY ONE!,Reddit is making me depressed.
3029,depression,I‚Äôm probably going to break up with my boyfriend soon. I wish I could have more self confidence but the world seems to think I don‚Äôt deserve it. I can‚Äôt stand it anymore.,"Im F19.
My ex was a cheating scumbag. He always compared me to other women he messed with and I was too afraid to leave because he always threatened suicide. 

My now boyfriend has a thing for blondes (I‚Äôm brunette/black hair). He‚Äôs asked me multiple times if I could wear a blonde wig and he told me a few weeks ago he had a dream about a blonde girl sucking him off. I‚Äôm probably going to break it off tomorrow, because I can‚Äôt keep going in this relationship when I know he has feelings like this. 

My confidence is dogshit already. I have absolutely no self worth and generally am just very nasty to myself. I‚Äôve been abandoned by all my family, I have no friends to turn to, and all I want to do is end it. The irrational thoughts and depressive episodes have gotten so bad with jealousy that anytime I see a moderately attractive girl I want to cry and breakdown. 

I will never be as pretty or be as worth as them. Why do they always have to have the nice lives and friends? I buy thousands of dollars worth of clothes and products to make myself look better and NOTHING works, but they just smile and wave and get tons of friends. The only reason I had two boyfriends in the first place is because I knew them beforehand when we were kids, but if I broke up with my boyfriend I highly doubt any guy who values his social standing would even look at me, let alone ask me out or anything. Even though I‚Äôm 19, I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúlet loose‚Äù and party and do all that shit. I just want a quiet normal life but I feel when everyone is done with that phase in their life, it‚Äôll be in our late 20‚Äôs and by then it‚Äôs hard to start a family or whatnot, considering it takes years to get to know someone enough to want to marry them. 

Im going to fucking die alone, I swear to god. This always fucking happens. Something good happens and it turns out to be too good to be true."
3030,depression,im hurting so bad,"idk what to do anymore. it feels like nobody cares about me anymore. i can‚Äôt stop crying, i cry all fucking day and i hate it. sometimes i don‚Äôt even realize right away that i‚Äôm crying. i don‚Äôt know how to get better anymore. everything is so meaningless now, nobody wants me anymore. i tried so hard to be good and a good friend and a good person and i‚Äôd like to believe i was. i don‚Äôt want to die yet, even though i can‚Äôt stop thinking about killing myself, i just want to sleep forever or at least a very long time. but right now i have a tiny cat calico critter and i‚Äôve named him Truffle, and he makes me feel better because i feel like he doesn‚Äôt feel burdened by me telling him about my problems. i can‚Äôt do anything right anymore, everything i create it hideous, everything i say is ugly, everything i do is wrong. i‚Äôm trying very hard to still seem happy, but i can‚Äôt do that right either. my heart aches very bad, my whole body does. i haven‚Äôt felt this sad in a year. i hope this passes soon."
3031,depression,I‚Äôm (23F) embarrassed and ashamed to share my feelings with my partner (27M) because I don‚Äôt want him to feel like I play victim.,"For starters, I apologize for the rambling and unorganized aspect of this post but I‚Äôm just in the thick of it. There‚Äôs no way for me to genuinely paint the whole picture with all the details, but I did my best. I read a lot on this sub to try to find clarity for myself and I‚Äôm hoping to be able to lean on this community‚Äîcraziness and all. If anything it was a good opportunity to vent. 

I‚Äôve been feeling ashamed of my depression and I‚Äôm having a hard time sharing my emotions with my partner of just over a year. For about two years, I‚Äôve been professionally diagnosed and treated by a psychologist for major depressive and anxiety disorder. That being said, now that I understand my mental illness, it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve battled for years prior. 

This means I have frequent highs and lows, overall lack of motivation, extreme fatigue, I cry a lot, and an ever-changing sex drive. All of which cause a great deal of friction in my relationship (especially the sex thing). 

I have always been the type to be transparent about my feelings to help the people around me understand what I‚Äôm going through. Lately, however, I‚Äôve been feeling like my openness about my low emotions has been causing more damage. 

It‚Äôs happened before, but this week in particular, I‚Äôve felt like my partner has been dedicating a lot of time to his routine. He still is working full time from home while I‚Äôm on minimal work-from-home (video meetings and online training for about 6-8 hours a week). I have tried to create a routine for myself and even cut out cannabis in an attempt to stay productive and motivated during the stay-at-home order. Unfortunately, the highs and lows of my depression seem to be more intense. I can‚Äôt keep myself busy and I‚Äôm constantly comparing my productivity to that of my partner. 

Ultimately, I think I get super insecure because he seems to be so on top of his responsibilities and self-motivated. As a result, I will get sad and cry about not feeling like we are living our lives together or spending enough time together. If I really analyze our interactions, we do make time to have meals together, he brings me coffee in the mornings, we are very open and verbal about our affection for one another. 

I start to get in the headspace of feeling like my emotions aren‚Äôt justified and I‚Äôm just being insecure. Why should I feel this way if I can think of all the good things from our relationship? I just haven‚Äôt been taking criticism well and have been feeling extra needy. It seems like my partner is having a hard time continuing to comfort me. 

Specifically, today (and the last couple days, but today was by far the worst) I had been feeling light headed and faint all day‚Äîlike abnormally exhausted. I got through my day of meetings and side projects, made all of our meals, ran errands... by the end of the day I was just totally wiped. My arms and legs were starting to feel tingly and I just had to go to sleep. Obviously this whole day I‚Äôve been expressing how I‚Äôm not feeling right and my partner would ask what he could do to help. 

After my most recent breakdown about not feeling like we get quality time together, he even took a day off from his side project to spend the evening with me. I was so grateful, but I just felt so sick and fell asleep. When I woke up I was still feeling bad and he reluctantly came into the room and asked what‚Äôs wrong and then made a comment (jokingly from his perspective) that there‚Äôs always some ailment with me and I‚Äôm his broken girl. I was immediately filled with undeniable guilt. The last thing I want is to be broken or be the girl who always has some issue and needs saving. 

I just don‚Äôt know what to do because my feelings are real and I know I have a mental illness‚ÄîI want to be able to be open and recognize my feelings with my partner, but I also worry it‚Äôs causing more issues."
3032,depression,Cutting a friend out who is nothing but supportive,"My best friend of six years has been nothing but supportive and encouraging with my struggles yet I still cut him out of my life. He's the only one who has ever known how truly bad it can get and has been there for me, yet I hate that he wants me to be happy and successful. I don't know if it's that because he's the only person to know this much, if it's because I'm more comfortable hating myself than being positive, if it's jealousy and spite and trust issues, or probably all of the above and then some.

All I know is that when I'm with him I don't hate him, but as soon as I'm away and alone I suddenly despise him. Like my mind completely warps who he is into someone I detest. I'm afraid that if I try to reconnect he'll either refuse for his own health, or that I'll inevitably cut him out again like an asshole, and this makes me afraid that I'll treat everybody who gets close like this. I can be remorseful and positive now, but when I begin slipping again any logic will go out the window and I'll revert to anger and isolation."
3033,depression,Anyone else accepted the way things are?,[removed]
3034,depression,I've never been so tempted by suicide...,"I went to my kitchen looking for ibuprofen cuz I have a headache and saw some painkillers. My first thought was just what the title hints at. ""What if I killed myself with these?"" And I closed the cabinet. I never thought that would be how I'd kill myself until 10 minutes ago. When its staring me in the face almost screaming ""over dose on me!"" its so hard not too. But I thought about the few real reasons I have to fight. In a way I feel like I've matured talking to my girlfriend when she's depressed. I've started thinking about the reasons for me to fight. And it helps so fucking much. I realized I do have reasons for myself and not just to make other people happy. In a way I started thinking about myself a bit more. Id recommend it."
3035,depression,Depressing thought,"No one would be perfectly correct in either side of the coin. Laws are there for a reason. If the law states this or the procedure states this and that then do what is due. Problem is laws can be repealed. Why pass through time arguing over Laws that can change, can be repealed, made by a group of a few, supposedly to be followed by all. Justice in this world is impossible - we can't agree on anything as a Human Race. Empires fall and along with it laws change, to favor its present slaves, to dull the pain. This justice served differently across different epochs, same thing - people felt justified, some not. Laws would favor you today, come a different time it won't. Laws change, feelings of justice change, people die anyway, worse is that the version of justice when they lived didn't favor their cause. Imaginary almost, we make vivid dreams of perfection and order and it will stay that way, a dream while being awake. Humanity's Justice is based on Luck and Chance - Real Justice is straightforward and true and that is when death comes, we all face the same fate. When we are all silent of how we killed ourselves slowly instead of actually living. Maybe it is the dead who mourns for the living. A depressing thought it is."
3036,depression,How am i supposed to keep going if i can't get help and can't get any better?,"My exams are coming up, i feel like i'm not prepared at all, my mental health is fucked, my physical one is also not great, and i can't get help because of how boomers my parents are, also i can't improve myself because for example i cannot change my environment, i'm trapped into having to study when i wish i could give attention to more parts of my life. i'm writing this in the middle of a online class because i cant go on like this. i cant man.

This is like the 100th post i write desperately here on reddit and nothing has changed, why even try anymore (dont think that i didnt try in real life)

i dont like this world at all i prefer sleeping"
3037,depression,"Why the fuck I have just two model? Suicidal Vs there is nothing better than this life, sulking Vs feeling like dancing and hugging everyone. I wish to be ok being normal, but I just can't in the middleway :'(",
3038,depression,I feel too far gone for anyone to care. Depression has made me horribly boring.,"I don't really seek out help because I feel bad for oversharing, so I'm not trying to blame people for not noticing or anything, but I just feel like I'm not worth the effort of trying to help. 

I've been depressed for so long that instead of ""nothing that used to be important seems fun anymore"", which is a warning sign, has turned into ""no interests, hobbies, or discernible personality"". I've become boring because depression has spent years hollowing me out from the inside. Why would anyone want to help someone who doesn't have anything to offer to the world by recovering. 

I'm not crying out for help or fighting to get better, I'm not trying to throw a pity party, I just hate how I'm not a person anymore. How I'm scared to talk to new people, not because I'm horribly socially awkward or anything, but because I know I have nothing to offer. It takes one simple question about what I do for fun or what I like for me to inevitably draw a blank and for someone to immediately lose interest. I just want things to be fun again. Even the stuff I enjoy never seems worth the effort. I'm sleeping 12 hours a day just to pass the time and hopefully fast forward until things get better, but I know they won't. I'm not suicidal but I feel like I'm complicit in wasting my life, which might as well be the same thing to me. 

I feel so detached from basic human interaction. Friendships and a life outside of the bare minimum is so distant to me it feels like something that only happens in movies at this point. I even feel bad typing this all out because I feel dramatic, but I just wish I was worth someone's time or effort. I wish I could be someone's friend, and someone could enjoy being mine. I want something to offer. I'm exhausted."
3039,depression,Ever feel like you‚Äôre just an old shell of the person you used to be?,"Stuck between hanging on to my old self and just accepting I‚Äôm not that anymore I don‚Äôt even recognize myself anymore.  I‚Äôm stuck between fighting another day and just giving up. I feel so alone but don‚Äôt like being around anyone. I have no desire to make an effort in seeing anyone or contacting friends/ family. I‚Äôm just existing these days hoping one day a switch will flip. Everyday this dark hole I‚Äôm in gets a little deeper. And I hate talking about my problems cause I feel misunderstood or written off , for some reason I want my problems to really resonate with anyone I explain them to (maybe so I don‚Äôt feel all alone?) idk if I‚Äôll ever genuinely feel happy again. Sorry I just needed to rant üòû"
3040,depression,I felt peace with being dead for a brief moment,"I wanna preface this with saying that at the same time I feel scared of death and a little scared of living. Tonight I cut myself and I went through the same shit by listening to sad music, overthinking, and wallowing in my misery. But once I threw myself onto my bed, stared at the ceiling and spaced out, I felt ok with being completely dead for a moment. Idk how to describe because it was really weird but I‚Äôll do my best if you understand. But I was laying on my bed staring at the ceiling and everybody dies in their nightmares started playing. Once the song came on I started shivering a lot while listening to it, completely motionless, and once it stopped, I stopped shivering, spaced out, and just felt lifeless for a little bit with a sharp pain in my heart, wishing that it could end tonight, and it felt kinda good for a bit. That‚Äôs the best I could describe my experience tonight and maybe someone else has felt something similar?"
3041,depression,I have felt lost for five years with no goals and no dreams...,"I have felt lost for five years, no matter how happy or sad I am...

For the past five years I‚Äôve battled with depression. Early on I felt it the worst, I had thoughts of suicide and I separated myself from everyone who I loved and cared about. Over the years, I began to slowly understand my depression, but still succumb to it. I would have happy days/weeks/months, but at the end of the day I would still be alone with my thoughts at night, and it would all come back to me.

I finally saw a therapist, but it didn‚Äôt help very much, even though I really tried to give it my best effort. I believe one day I will try therapy again, but I don‚Äôt feel like trying again so soon after it didn‚Äôt work out. 

Recently, even with corona going on, I‚Äôve been in a limbo, and after reading through some posts, I can tell I‚Äôm not alone. As people are stuck inside with their own thoughts, it can be hard, even though your daily stresses aren‚Äôt as high.

My problem is that I have been trying to control my thoughts and work on my mental health during this time, but I feel lost in my life. I am on a career path that was chosen for me by my parents. They paid for me to go to college and get a great degree at a respected university, but I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm on the right path. I enjoy what I‚Äôm studying in school, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs what I want to do for the rest of my life, and at this point I typically hear two things, either ‚Äúyou only have one life, do what makes you happy‚Äù or ‚Äútake a semester/year off and decide what you want to do‚Äù and both of these don‚Äôt work for me.

I don‚Äôt know what makes me happy. I‚Äôve spent every night for the past five years trying to focus on the things that make me happy and often times it just comes down to the people closest to me. I don‚Äôt seem to have any passions or goals or even really hobbies. Thus, I don‚Äôt really have any careers that excite me, unlike some of my friends who have had dreams of jobs they‚Äôve wanted to do since they were a kid.

I guess I ask you, if you are still reading, what would you do if you were me? If you had no goals or dreams in life, but you were on a path you didn‚Äôt necessarily want to be on? 

I can‚Äôt leave the path because that would require choosing another path, and I don‚Äôt know which path I would even pick. However I can‚Äôt stay on the path I‚Äôm on because that‚Äôs a life wasted.

Thank you if you read this far, this is my first time posting about my mental health publicly on the internet."
3042,depression,We exist to suppress our own existence,"Why do we exist? We exist to hate each present existence. We can't get what we want because if we do, we are bad. We don't even get what we need. We were born to experience suffering or at least to suffer for others. We are alive to slowly kill ourselves with living, kill ourselves with the desire to keep on living even if we always get shit, get used, get discriminated, bullied and spat upon by those people who have more desire than us to keep on living only for all of us to meet the same fate - dust."

3046,depression,I don't know what to do.,"Hello, for a little context I'm a college student and I just finished my second semester from home. My home life could've been much worse, but it broke me down over time. Split households with a bipolar mother who regularly gave up on me and my sister when all we needed was a little support, what were essentially multiple divorces, a disabled veteran father who couldnt understand the line between helping and degrading, and a grandmother who forced her way into our lives and has tried to put my dad on the streets for years. It's been really tough, but I naturally struggled with anxiety and depression, and they just got compounded by the situation.

On top of that, I am really bad at connecting with people in meaningful ways. I've had very few good friends and I cant manage to keep any because my low confidence makes it really hard to be the one to reach out. College helped me turn some of this around. It gave me some time away from home to try to address some of the pain and heal, and make meaningful friendships. College was the first chance I've had to heal in nearly 7 years.

And then Covid struck. I had to move back home. I've had to say goodbye to some of the only positive friendships I had and move directly back in to a large source of trauma growing up. Its killing me.

I'm here because I dont know what to do. I can no longer even picture a future for myself. I'm really only here for the remainder of summer, and next semester is in 2 and a half months, but its beyond my reasoning. I'm stuck mentally, I feel worthless, I'm alone aside from the family that never treated me well to begin with, and I'm losing it a little.

Anybody have any words of wisdom they'd like to share? I know that was kind of an info dump but I'm really going through it right now and I'd appreciate any help anyone can offer."
3047,depression,How I cope with my life playing games or being on PC,"20 M here and I never thought I would be typing this but I've regretted the decisions I've made in my life. I am here sitting at home all day playing video games for the last 2 years of my life. I don't know what happened to me, i was always a bright kid but as I got older, i lost interest in things and had no drive to move forward.

this led to me dropping out of college and spending my whole 2 years gaming, hooking up with girls on tinder or sulking everyday. I never thought i would be this way but it has come to this point. I never had a core group of friends which I was a part of and seeing my school buddies move on with their lives just makes me feel more bad about myself. Its just I just stopped being myself but I cant go and see a therapist since I am from India and there is a stigma associated with mental health.

I hate seeing my friends going to prestigious colleges which I could've been a part of, hate seeing them going to parties leaving me behind in the dust; like i've been forgotten. Even my childhood friends who I grew up playing with meet behind my back and go on treks etc which really hurts me because they come to my every birthday to wish me like they are doing me a favour. which makes me more angry is that I've been nice to everyone growing up and all I got is just bullshit from everyone. Even I thought my GF loved me but she turned out to be a 2 faced bitch aswell like the others. I have a shit ton of anger issues and mabye depression but i cant say for sure since i have not being diagnosed. I was gonna take admission in college this year but i am worried due to the virus everything is closed.

I became jealous of everything my friends have achieved but I cant seem to shake this feeling of drowning I have. I spend my days just sitting in front of the computer playing games, working out or watching movies, i hate being the person i have become.

I wish i was like everybody else, have a life, friends, college etc. 

the most amusing thing is that my parents  have almost the same problem as me, my mom regrets not working and feels like a loser, dad barely goes out and lost his company. I dont know if it is a genetic thing but i hate living like this."
3048,depression,Feeling numb,"I cant sleep but im so tired. I feel numb and empty like some kind of hollow shell. I wish I could sleep at night or not feel so depressed. The world is going to shit and its so scary, I miss when things were better. All the things that are going on make me want to just die or go into a coma for a few years. Jnf"
3049,depression,"Started opening up to my bf and a close friend about being depressed. They ask how they can help me, but I don't even know how they can.","Quarantine has hit me hard. I have not had a really bad despressive episode in a long time, alongside my GAD. I even began self harming again. I finally decided to open up about it to my bf and a close friend, and they both have asked how they can help, but I don't even know how they can help right now. I don't want them to feel like crap because I can't think of anything they can do to help me, but I also don't know what to tell them. I need things to go back to normal for me to start feeling better, or at least that's what I think might make me feel better. What do you tell people when they ask how they can help?"
3050,depression,Feeling sorry for myself for once,"I never feel sorry for myself. I'm always trying to keep everyone around me happy but for once I just can't anymore. I know people go through way worse but I'm reaching my limit. I've had a bad week. Like a really bad week. The thoughts of suicide are constant. Ending this pain. I go into school for part of the week as I'm not trusted alone and it is a good distraction. I saw one of my favourite teachers who was the only person I'd ever go to if I had problems, we had nice fun chats and I'd chill in her room. She was like a friend as I'd locked everyone else out. And we made eye contact yesterday and she completely blanked me, I even smiled in a ""hello"" way. It wouldn't normally bother me so much but that just hurt. I know she's not my friend but she really helped me out so it feels like I've lost another friend. And I don't even know what I did wrong. Since Wednesday my chest hurts whenever I take a deep breath I have to breath shallow and when I lie down on my right side it hurts, like a sharp stabbing pain on the left side of my heart. I'm Suicidal anyway so if it's anything bad then I guess God wants me gone too so I've not told anyone about that. Life is such a bitch. No matter how happy I'll ever be, I'll always have regrets. It's too much, everything is too much and for once in my fucking life I'm feeling sorry for myself. And I can't even talk to my therapist until next week and the other therapy agency who's supposed to check up on me didn't even check up. They are probably just really busy anyway or they just forgot but that's okay. I cant deal with the quarantine climate either. I've felt this way for too long. The only thing stopping me from ending my life is the lack of lethal tools as my mum took them all away. That doesn't make me feel safe, it makes me feel trapped. Everything is telling me to just end this pain. To find peace. I think I'm going to find a way soon. To make it all stop."
3051,depression,"I am stupid, dumb, ignorant, retarded and don't deserve to be alive.","I am 39 with learning issues and minor brain damage and I have a hell of a record of mental illness ranging from dyslexia to cptsd, severe chronic depression, severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia, ocd, add, The list goes on and all of these are confirmed by my psychiatrist which took years. 

I have a black spot under my tooth inside the bone thats an infection and I was on meds the crown on the tooth is broke and needs a new crown but I can't afford the 1300 its going to cost to fix and there is no dental colleges around me. 

I live on disability and the stimulus check thing I used to put towards getting myself out of debt, paying bills I needed to pay that I was months behind on. so I have no money.

I have nothing but 4 shirts, 4 pairs of pants, old run down shoes that are falling apart. a cheap laptop that can barely handle video games.

I am sitting here thinking of everyone who has come and gone in my life, my mom, dad, grandma, who are dead. my old friend I had who didn't want anything to do with me anymore back in 2012 she cut me out of her life. 

Had another friend who I used to play world of warcraft with who I lost contact with in 2009 and I sit here thinking about her nonstop and how I miss the times we had. Then there was another world of warcraft friend I had who I miss deeply who introduced me to sick puppies one night when we were talking about songs. And as I type this I am listening to the song she introduced me to and crying hysterically how I miss her.

I have no other friends, no family. I am utterly alone in this world and I am not that smart for example I tried getting back into WoW a few months ago and I can't understand half the stuff in the game or what to do. I struggle with reading and writing. I am using google voice to text to type this.

I am so tired of being like this and so tired of every time I let someone in my life they up and abandon me and leave me. It is so hard for me to let people go and to forget about them. I think about them years later and miss them, the more days that go by the more years that go by the harder it gets that I miss them more. 

I wish I had my mom and dad and grandma back, wish I had my friends back and wish I had a way to get this tooth fixed before my jaw rots off from infection and can get the tooth fixed so I can chew since I lost most my teeth on my right side on the bottom. I get this tooth pulled I won't have anything in the side or back to chew on. 

I am so tired of this life and struggling like this. No one will hire me because of my mental issues and people up and leave after talking to me for awhile. I am so tired of life. it shouldn't be this hard and this difficult. I feel like death would be better than this at least I wouldn't be struggling anymore to survive and wouldn't be missing anyone."
3052,depression,Back at it again,[removed]
3053,depression,Why don‚Äôt friends and family love me anymore? I feel so alone all the time.,"Firstly, I hope this is the right subreddit to post to. I initially thought about posting elsewhere (/r/relationship\_advice, amongst others), but I think it ultimately stems from my depression. Here goes!  

Forewarning: I‚Äôve spent the better half of 2 hours trying to put what I feel into words here, and what I‚Äôve written below is the best I can come up with, but it still doesn‚Äôt describe how hurt and unloved and lonely I feel. Also, trigger warning for mentions of suicide and suicidal thoughts. 

I live, but I feel like I am dying inside. I‚Äôm a 26-year-old male. I \*think\* I‚Äôm attractive (although a little overweight). I have a good job, friends, and family that I love, hobbies I enjoy, and goals that I have (and aim) to achieve. I love myself (but not in an egotistical way, I think), exercise most days of the week and eat relatively healthily, but despite all of this, I feel empty and alone all of the time. 

In regards to my social life, I have to be the one to reach out to friends and family and organise things otherwise they don‚Äôt (ever), despite their promises to do so. I love my friends and family immensely, and I have said this to them, but they don‚Äôt reciprocate, ever. When we do hang out, albeit rarely nowadays, they don‚Äôt ask about my life or invite me to anything, which makes me feel they don‚Äôt want to know me anymore. They don‚Äôt reciprocate the effort I put into being a fucking fantastic friend. For example, I \*flew\* to the other side of the fucking country to see my best friend for his birthday in October last year (we hadn‚Äôt seen each other face-to-face for over two years, despite our regular catchups online). My birthday is a few months after his. How did he reciprocate? He forgot my birthday. I was his first friend when he moved to the city and university nine years ago. Nine fucking years, and he still doesn‚Äôt know when my birthday is. Cunt.

Despite all of this, I try to stay positive and involved in their life because I love them. They know I love them, but I haven‚Äôt heard them reciprocate it, which makes me feel fucking awful about myself, as if something is so wrong with me it makes people not love me. I know I‚Äôm a decent person, and I try to be a positive influence (most of the time). I ask about, discuss and remember important things that are going on in their life, joke around with them, share passions and goals I‚Äôve achieved with them, and be a good friend/brother/son/relative when we hang out. I know I‚Äôm a smart person who likes to have long discussions about the things that matter. I offer to be there when I think they‚Äôre having a bad time, but when I have gone to them for help, I feel they put me at arm‚Äôs length to stop them from catching whatever it is that gave me depression. 

Friends and family don‚Äôt reciprocate my love for them, and it‚Äôs killing me. I don't know if my friends or family love me anymore. I haven‚Äôt heard anyone I love return ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to my face (or even in a text or missed call) to me in a very, very long time, which makes me feel unbearably unloved and alone. It‚Äôs like everyone doesn‚Äôt care about me anymore, which makes the fight against my depression and the suicidal thoughts impossibly hard alone. I‚Äôve been on medication and seeing psychologists since I was 20, and these two things are the only things that are keeping me alive right now. Before COVID, I was playing social sports with a few insular groups, but none of these activities makes me feel loved. I don‚Äôt have a girlfriend, and most dates I‚Äôve had in my life don‚Äôt get past the introductory phase. I just feel so god damn alone, and I‚Äôm losing reasons to live. Me loving me isn‚Äôt enough, and I‚Äôm so fucking tired of being alone on team Me. 

How do I feel loved again, despite no one else loving me? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I havent felt love from another human being in a long time and it's going to kill me."

3055,depression,Asking for help makes me feel needy,"I know that i should not feel this way, but i don't like discussing anything mental health outside of my therapist. Especially when it may be crucial to help someone understand me better. If my teachers ever ask   why i did poorly on a test, or my parents asking about something. I would never tell them about whats going on and sort of plead the 5th. I don't like to appear weak/looking for pick me ups. Which I feel like would happen if I ever tell people about whats going on in my head. I'm trying to improve this through the anonymity of the internet. So reddit, how should i ask for help or patience  for me for those close to me, without appearing to needy. Any replies are appreciated, thanks."

3057,depression,Empty,"I‚Äôm nothing more then a husk of the person I used to be. I don‚Äôt even remember the old me. But yet I‚Äôm not mad or scared, I just feel indifferent about my situation. I guess I‚Äôm a little disturbed by this. I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm writing this. Maybe I‚Äôm seeking attention maybe I just want someone to say ‚Äúhey its ok man things will get better just give it time‚Äù for what just to fall into the same loop idk. Sorry if this doesn‚Äôt make sense i just needed to put this out there I guess to vent thx to who ever actually reads this mess."
3058,depression,Late night paranoia,"Disclaimer: I am having troubles putting my thoughts down in English so if it doesn't make any sense I am sorry. 
So last night I was having troubles falling asleep and so I started thinking about when it was that my depression started. But I couldn't really pin point it. However thinking about it I started to notice that a lot of it was ""external"". It's like the road to adulthood is constellated by attacks on your self-esteem. I started thinking about how normal character flaw I had through out my life and used to be considered quirks started to be judged in a heavier and heavier way. But not just by people around me, I think that's normal. What I mean is that in recent years I've been coming across a lot of articles, essays, videos that analyze how character flaws are a sign of mental hillness and you have to fix them to be normal.
Like in my teens it used to be that I was shy but now that's not a characteristic, it's a problem, it means something is wrong. 
In my teens I used to be very nice. Now it means that I am a pushover and something is wrong.
I've always been ok on my own and not going out much to party because it bored me, and when I was a teen that was considered ""responsible, mature or whatever"". Now it means that I am a recluse and I can't enjoy life so something must be wrong with me.
So what I am asking myself is how much of my depression is mine and how much of it was that a perfect standard has been set for how a person should behave and if you don't fit that you have to be made to feel horrible and the only way is to change everything about you to fit the standard?"
3059,depression,The last and only time I tried to open up to my mom resulted in her trying to guilt the shit out of me,"A few months ago I expressed how I was feeling suicidal to my mom and she implied if I were to kill myself that she would do the same. She‚Äôs been forcing me to exercise cause she thinks that‚Äôll fix all my problems but when I tell her I still feel terrible mentally, she keeps saying shit like ‚Äúyour technique is bad‚Äù. No advice she‚Äôs ever given to me has helped so now whenever she gives advice my mind immediately thinks she‚Äôs full of shit

Anyways sorry for ranting I just got no one to open up to. xo"

3061,depression,I'm lost and don't know what to do.,"I need to be upfront, I'm looking for somewhat professional advice. I need someone to explain my problems to and get help.

3062,depression,Living in my secluded world,I shut myself out from the world.no friends. Or anyone close to me..i stay home avoiding people. I am unworthy and ugly and have non-confidence to put myself out there and do something for myself. The world feels intimidating and I'm shy and weird. I've honestly never had any real friends and the older I get I've just sheltered in my world and shielded myself from anything that could hurt me or make me uncomfortable.. I have no desire to live or do anything really.i feel apathetic to everything..what's the point
3063,depression,"any of you ever have 3 - 5 minutes where you're genuinely happy and not thinking of killing yourself? and once you realize, you almost cry?",it's rare but is that what it's like being normal?
3064,depression,"I feel worse and worse, while my family- the only anchor that keeps me alive- is dissappearing","Sorry for the incoherent thoughts, I am just venting a little bit.

I am in the last few months of my master degree. Soon, I'll be out there, getting a job and do the things I am supposed to. And I will inevitably get trampled on. I have no idea how an incompetent human being like me would survive out there. 

I've been feeling empty yet so heavy at the same time. I see no reason to go on. No purpose, no passion, not good at anything. Yet I have to get a job, settle down, take care of my family and take charge of multiple properties my parents are renting. All this overwhelming responsibilities, while I am just worried whether I will at least be able to get/hold a job or survive. 

Almost every time I think about death, my family is the only thing that keeps me going. I have no one to turn to, not even a friend. So they are what I considered a ""safe haven"", somewhere for me to return  to, where I feel supported. 

But their marriage is deeply unhappy and dysfunctional. As I try my best to help them deal with the problem, my mother went into a verbal fight with me and said many hurtful things. Although I have never told her about my depression, I know I would never be able to tell her (and my father). They have enough things occupying their minds, I can't add more to the problem.

And for the first time, I feel truly alone in the world. I have absolutely nobody to go to. For fuck sake, due to the pandemic I am currently in my home countries with my family right now so I couldn't even get professional help without them knowing. I am just merely existing and I am not sure how much longer can I go on."
3065,depression,Do I have depression or is Corona just taking a toll on me?,"This isn't the first time I've felt like this but it is the worst.

To give some back story, I was homeschooled for most of my life. Meaning I had no friends or social life, hell half the time I had to take a vitamin D pill because I was never outside.

Throughout high school I had a really tough time. I was slut shamed a lot despite doing nothing. I've constantly felt like people just want to use me for my body, even when there are no signs of it. Despite all that, I still did good in school.

This year though... My first semester of college one of my professors was sexually harrassing me, stalking my social medias, trying to blackmail me. I reported him and got an incomplete for the class. I was hoping of turning things around this semester, but then corona happened.

I just feel no motivation to do anything. Even typing this up feels like I'm moving in slow motion. I just feel like I'm back in middle school, trapped away from everything. I've completely given up on all my classes. It's been about a month and a half since I've done any work for them, and I'm trying so hard to just get motivated but it feels like it takes everything just to get out of bed. I don't shower on a regular basis, It's lucky if I eat a single meal a day, I could sleep for 16 hours or stay up for well over 48 hours with no problem, I've been cutting people out of my life, fighting with my boyfriend almost everytime I talk to him.

I know that none of you can diagnose me, but to those who struggle with depression, is this what it's like? Was it a gradual build up till your breaking point? Should I contact someone for help?"
3066,depression,I tried killing myself 8 days ago by hanging. I survived. Now I'll try Inert Gas Suicide,"I've been suffering from depression for past 7 years now. I had social anxiety from Idk (Hey you guys remember calling your mother MOM the first time. Me neither) yeah that long. 

So anyway it was just some bad and negative thoughts at first but after 2016 it became worst. Like hella bad. Life became hard and weird at the same time. It was like someone attached a heavy ass truck to me that no one could see. I lost all of my friends, gf, relationships, will to live, hobbies. I used to play guitar for 4 hrs a day 4 days a week. My college grade went from 4.8 GPA TO 1 something. And I didn't knew just what the f*ck was wrong with me.

Years passed and my thinking changed from, "" I'll live with it. I'm strong, to, fuck it I'll just end it cuz no matter how I try I can never beat this.""

So about a week ago I decided to kill myself by hanging but guess what at last moment the rope broke. Unfortunately I didn't get any brain damage and I'm well but wearing a turtleneck (u can see impression of ropes on my neck &amp; it fucking hurts)

You know how in movies when someone attempts suicide and it fails they be like, ""I'm born for a higher purpose, Maybe this is a signal bla bla bla."" Yeah it doesn't work like that. I'm even more depressed now, cuz I had one job to kill myself that too I couldn't do. 

I read about this Inert Gas Suicide on Internet and ordered a nitrogen cylinder, mask and tubes along with pressure regulator for a peaceful death in me sleep. But then Govt here banned dilvery of non-essential items bue to covid 19 (the only thing I don't have is pressure regulator, my lungs will explode if pressure is too high and I don't want a painful death) . So guess I'll have few more weeks. Thought I should post this here. 

I HAD a supportive friend circle, they helped me a lot, GF also helped. Everybody loved me and supported me when I confessed about my depression. After a year  they became tried and wanted me to be all right which I just can't. Because no matter how much anyone will help they can never out shout the voices in my head. 

I workout a lot. Eat healthy. Walk in nature. And I know no matter how hard I try nothing will get better."
3067,depression,Got my online exam for university,"It‚Äôs techically two essays that they gave us 24 hours to do. It‚Äôs due in 3 hours and I haven‚Äôt done it. In fact, for this subject I skipped every single lecture this semester. I am overwhelmed and can‚Äôt get out of bed. Nobody supports me or even cares. I just feel like giving up and crying lol"
3068,depression,I just really want to die full stop.,"For context I'm dying maybe 4 years at most left but it's taking a really long time I was done after spending a full 6 months of time in hospitals. I kept pushing after spending a full years worth of time in hospitals because of family. But around 4 or 5 months ago I said fuck it and fuck my family if they want to keep forcing me. I've been told I'm going to be thrown out if I don't continue with my treatments they fucking suck and don't help enough in terms of fixing me they just delay the progression. Every time I try to reason with them or get them to see my side they just guilt me into doing what they want or threaten me. I fucking loath living I cant kill myself because I'm broke and most methods take far to long and if I don't die but instead become even more crippled ohh god that's just going to make me try harder then I'll be forced into a mental hospital(not doing that shit again). I really hate living and dying this slowly just destroyed any love I've had for my mom and dad. When I got the news that I was going to die I was really happy but now that I have to live it out for this long(1year or so, so far) my depression came back or it could be because of my treatment."
3069,depression,Some nights I sleep early just so I don‚Äôt have to feel so empty,
3070,depression,I don‚Äôt know who i am anymore..,"I (24F) moved today Texas with my long term boyfriend a few years back. I‚Äôm originally from Michigan, born and raised. I lived in a small town and when i was 18 i got out of there as fast as i could go and went to Tennessee (to chase my dreams and gtfo). Met my boyfriend in college and wanted an even better life, so we moved to Texas. But, I‚Äôve never been so physically and emotionally alone. 

When i lived in Michigan, i was always with friends or family. There were rarely times i wasn‚Äôt surrounded by friends; Joking, laughing, partying, just being young and free. I always knew who i was. Even when i moved to Tennessee, i made friends and felt very confident in myself. 

I‚Äôve battled with anxiety and depression since i was 16 but I‚Äôve never felt overwhelmed until now. I don‚Äôt have any friends or family here. I like living here, though. But ive come to realize i don‚Äôt even know who i am, or really remember what it was like to be myself. I don‚Äôt remember how to bust people‚Äôs balls, how to have fun, i don‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs like not to be constantly worrying and stressed about the future. I don‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs like to be myself. I don‚Äôt even know what that would look like... or feel like. i used to be so confident in myself. I was so funny and people used to compliment my personality. I feel like a shell. I don‚Äôt know who i am anymore... i don‚Äôt recognize myself. I am a stranger to myself. 

Sorry if this is more like a rant or doesn‚Äôt belong here. I just, i don‚Äôt know where else i can find like-minded people who might feel the same or have and pulled out of it."
3071,depression,LOST,"I'm lost, really, really lost. Nothing has any flavour, nothing gives me any happiness on earth except things that end up destroying me. I always come back to suffering, I always come back to anger, disappointment and the desire to see the world fall with me, because that is all that has been given to me.

It is already written, this is the work I must do, to free my soul from this prison, and to bring with me those who share my pain.

We are in the kingdom of those who have fallen, all sons and daughters of the Demiurge, who can do nothing but imitate and lead to oblivion.

There is no reason to have hope once almost all hope has been crushed, and then there is only one thing left to do: Destroy what is left in us and destroy what is inside those to whom it has been given, to show them that we're all flawed."
3072,depression,How can I make myself believe in myself?,"My whole life I've felt stupid and not good enough, I will try things then give up before there's a test or some kind of review. Like I did a business course I really enjoyed it, until it got to the tests, I did the first 3 then when it came to the final I just didn't go, the teacher called me and tried to get to go in I put it off until was too late. I ended up getting my other results and for most things had been top of the class. 

It's not just school, it's everything I won't put myself forward for roles I know I can do because I don't want be rejected (at my current job and they oddly don't ask you if you want to further yourself/role they think you should ask because you get hired for a certain area and they kinda think that's it, but I've been questioned by managers why I haven't put myself out there for training/other roles which I've found out they've never done with others) 

I'm sure everyone hates me when I guess there's not much proof to that. 

It seems like others  believe in me, but tbh I think it's a trap or a joke when I know it's most likely not and they actually believe it. So how can I believe in myself and not just put myself down and behind?"
3073,depression,Just alone in the quarantine,"I just wanted to let it out. I have been on meds and if it wasn‚Äôt for that I would had probably killed myself already. But I haven‚Äôt so here I am trying to find a solution to everything and survive.
November, I started to have problems at work, I have worked there for 6 years and appreciated. But my performance and many mistakes cannot be ignored. However I feel lucky that I was given another chance, I know someone else would had been fired but I earned trust and at least this time it paid off. Then my 15 year old dog died in December. It was heartbreaking. He was my child, my companion and I would say even my best friend. He was sick and putting him down was soooo hard.
Then my husband left me. I think he was just waiting for my dog to die so he will not feel guilty if I had to call him to tell him about it. Or maybe because he knew it would destroy me to be alone for the holidays. (We moved to his country and I have my family far enough to afford to visit once every 3 years). And so in February after two months if trying our best not to fight and be better, he realized that he doesn‚Äôt want to change himself and his addiction problems. He wants to be free to do whatever he wants. 
Then March...my boss-mentor quit, she was my rock and the person that helped me the most in my career. I was feeling insecure about my work because the new person coming, how this will change the dynamics at work. Due to the lockdown we didn‚Äôt even have opportunity to say our goodbyes and to make sure everything was taken care of. We left that afternoon and where told not go go back to office. Me now alone with my cat. 
Since March I literally had little contact with anyone. I was so depressed in general that I was not even eating, I had some protein shakes and that was pretty much my food for like weeks. I went out of the house 3 times. To buy essentials. I have spoke with friends online but I was so embarrassed to even tell them that I was alone through all this. I am afraid. I cried, I have worries about my finances and my living situation. My husband is not willing to help with anything. So 60% of my salary is towards rent and the rest to food, gas, bills and literally nothing else. 
At least my student loan is paused. 
Then my resident status. It expired in between this madness. To renew it I need my husband to apply. I need to pay as well over 300‚Ç¨. If I don‚Äôt get it I need to leave the country in 3 months. I can‚Äôt even afford to imagine if I have to move 12 years of my life in two suitcases and my cat. 
I just can‚Äôt. Go back home broke and single at 39 with nothing on my name. 
What can I do? I am supposed to go back to work in June, but still having a good job cannot help me with the issues of insufficient money. 
I am to the point of thinking to prostitute myself because I am completely lost and nobody of my friends or family are going to be able to help me.  I speak Spanish and I offered classes online but nobody wants. I don‚Äôt know what else to offer,I started to sell stuff from my house but this is nothing.  What electrical 
I don‚Äôt know what to do, I am alone in another country and I feel overwhelmed. My rent is cheap compared to price‚Äôs now so I cannot move to cheaper. Why is this happening to me? My dad cannot even afford to pay my burial expenses if I kill myself here. He is old and I cannot even help him with money or viceversa Nobody cares, what to do? Sometimes I just want to dissolve and not be a problem for anyone else."
3074,depression,Moving too fast/still sorta wanting death?,"I‚Äôve had past experiences with depression, I wasn‚Äôt suicidal but at one point in my life I just started hoping I‚Äôd die within the next couple years or so. At this point I feel as if I‚Äôve overcome depression. I‚Äôve won. However I still feel as if dying wouldn‚Äôt be so bad. Like even though I‚Äôm fairly happy now, I still want to die in the next few years just to forget everything. 

I also feel as if I‚Äôm moving too fast, something bad will happen, I‚Äôll crash and spiral back down to depression. I‚Äôm just moving to fast and steady for my own good. 

I honesty don‚Äôt know, it just feels like a gut feeling. I don‚Äôt want to die, but I do. I‚Äôm happy to be happy, but something is wrong. Anyone know why I feel this way?"
3075,depression,I need help,"It‚Äôs pretty comforting to read some of the threads here on r/depression. It makes me feel less alone. I have a pretty extreme story. A lot of bad shit has happened and not a lot of good. I was reading a thread about people that have been battling their depression and haven‚Äôt been able to finish their online university obligations and started writing this as a reply to relate to their stories of having a hard time with their studies/mental health during this quarantine until I  realized I might of got carried away and I might not relate to their life‚Äôs much(idk). So here‚Äôs what I wrote. I haven‚Äôt even finished high school. I‚Äôm 27 years old. My dad and grandma paid to sign me up for a online high school diploma class 2 years ago. Ive been struggling with addiction my whole life and had to drop out at 18 years old because my life was unmanageable as fuck on drugs. I‚Äôve been to many rehabs(over 20) and sober livings(a lot). I‚Äôve been homeless, I‚Äôve overdosed, I‚Äôve wanted life to have mercy on me and take me out so I wouldn‚Äôt have to suffer. It started to seem like a sick joke to me from the amount of pain that I‚Äôve been in. August 2019 Somehow I finally was able to get sober. IMy grandma let me move back into her house and I got 2 jobs as a server. It was helping having jobs, feeling somewhat productive and having a reason to get out of bed. I was still very depressed. I don‚Äôt have any friends anymore because of the lifestyle I have lived(using drugs in isolation, destroying family/friend relationships and shutting everyone out all for the sake of finding relief in a very messed up way). All of my experiences have beat me down to a shell of a shell. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm capable of much anymore. I feel damaged. After moving in I ended up relapsing a couple short times but bounced back somehow and kept both of my jobs. I‚Äôm looking for a solution and I know it‚Äôs not just one thing that will do it. Ive tried AA/NA SO MANY times and have had a lot of success with it, but after relapsing a lot, even most people in the meetings don‚Äôt really want much to do with me because I haven‚Äôt been able to get this thing(imagine not even being accepted by another junkie). I know I could try different meetings but at this point I‚Äôm pretty AA‚ÄôD out and cant see myself doing another fucking fourth step. Ive tried a lot of different anti depressants and haven‚Äôt found one that has helped yet. I am currently trying to get help by an patient assistant foundation for a new ground breaking anti depressant that can work instantly but the back and forth between the foundation and myself has been harder than I feel like it should be for a depressed person to get help from a company that is supposed to help people get their depression medication. (Tangent, sorry) The quarantine has not helped at all and I‚Äôm falling apart more so . I did start seeing a therapist. Despite all of the reasons to better myself, I can‚Äôt find the motivation and can‚Äôt make the connection in my fucked up brain to get myself out of this shithole. I need help but really feel I can‚Äôt help myself. I feel stuck"
3076,depression,A quote,"‚ÄúWhen your not that invested in life, it is easy to accept the certainty of death‚Äù, read it on a microdosing thread, I think it helped but I‚Äôm not sure. Maybe I just need to re-invest, it‚Äôs just frustrating I guess. Hope it helps,"
